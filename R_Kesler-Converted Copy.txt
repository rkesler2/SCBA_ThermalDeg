AB  - Firefighters are required to perform a variety of strenuous occupational tasks that require high levels of both aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Thus, it is critical that firefighters train at an appropriate intensity to develop adequate levels of aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Circuit training is a unique training method that stresses both energy systems and therefore may be a viable training method to enhance firefighter preparedness. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the aerobic and anaerobic intensities of a circuit-based workout to physiological data previously reported on firefighters performing fire suppression and rescue tasks. Twenty career firefighters performed a workout that included 2 rotations of 12 exercises that stressed all major muscle groups. Heart rate was recorded at the completion of each exercise. Blood lactate was measured before and approximately 5 minutes after the workout. The workout heart rate and post-workout blood lactate responses were statistically compared to data reported on firefighters performing fire suppression and rescue tasks. The mean circuit-training heart rate was similar to previously reported heart rate responses from firefighters performing simulated smoke-diving tasks (79 +/- 5 vs. 79 +/- 6% maximum heart rate [HRmax], p = 0.741), but lower than previously reported heart rate responses from firefighters performing fire suppression tasks (79 +/- 5 vs. 88 +/- 6% HRmax, p < 0.001). The workout produced a similar peak blood lactate compared to that when performing firefighting tasks (12 +/- 3 vs. 13 +/- 3 mmol.L(-1), p = 0.084). In general, the circuit-based workout produced a lower cardiovascular stress but a similar anaerobic stress as compared to performing firefighting tasks. Therefore, firefighters should supplement low-intensity circuit-training programs with high-intensity cardiovascular and resistance training (e.g., >/=85% 1-repetition maximum) exercises to adequately prepare for the variable physical demands of firefighting.

AB  - Translocation and colocalization of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) with regulatory proteins represents a critical step in translation initiation of protein synthesis in vitro. However, mechanistic insight into the control of postprandial skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates at rest and after an acute bout of endurance exercise in humans is lacking. In crossover trials, eight endurance-trained men received primed-continuous infusions of L-[ring-(2) H(5) ]phenylalanine and consumed a mixed-macronutrient meal (18 g protein, 60 g carbohydrates, 17 g fat) at rest (REST) and after 60 min of treadmill running at 70% VO(2peak) (EX). Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected to measure changes in phosphorylation and colocalization in the mTORC1-pathway, in addition to rates of myofibrillar (MyoPS) and mitochondrial (MitoPS) protein synthesis. MyoPS increased (P < 0.05) above fasted in REST (~2.1-fold) and EX (~twofold) during the 300 min postprandial period, with no corresponding changes in MitoPS (P > 0.05). TSC2/Rheb colocalization decreased below fasted at 60 and 300 min after feeding in REST and EX (P < 0.01). mTOR colocalization with Rheb increased above fasted at 60 and 300 min after feeding in REST and EX (P < 0.01), which was consistent with an increased phosphorylation 4E-BP1(Thr37/46) and rpS6(ser240/244) at 60 min. Our data suggest that MyoPS, but not MitoPS, is primarily nutrient responsive in trained young men at rest and after endurance exercise. The postprandial increase in MyoPS is associated with an increase in mTOR/Rheb colocalization and a reciprocal decrease in TSC2/Rheb colocalization and thus likely represent important regulatory events for in vivo skeletal muscle myofibrillar mRNA translation in humans.

AB  - Interventions aimed at increasing fat metabolism could potentially reduce the symptoms of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes and may have tremendous clinical relevance. Hence, an understanding of the factors that increase or decrease fat oxidation is important. Exercise intensity and duration are important determinants of fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates increase from low to moderate intensities and then decrease when the intensity becomes high. Maximal rates of fat oxidation have been shown to be reached at intensities between 59% and 64% of maximum oxygen consumption in trained individuals and between 47% and 52% of maximum oxygen consumption in a large sample of the general population. The mode of exercise can also affect fat oxidation, with fat oxidation being higher during running than cycling. Endurance training induces a multitude of adaptations that result in increased fat oxidation. The duration and intensity of exercise training required to induce changes in fat oxidation is currently unknown. Ingestion of carbohydrate in the hours before or on commencement of exercise reduces the rate of fat oxidation significantly compared with fasted conditions, whereas fasting longer than 6 h optimizes fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates have been shown to decrease after ingestion of high-fat diets, partly as a result of decreased glycogen stores and partly because of adaptations at the muscle level.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of time of day on cardiac reactivity (CR) during the performance of two vigilance tasks (auditory and visual reaction time) and a working memory task. Heart rate was measured hourly (08:00-21:00 h) at rest and during performance tasks in 20 men and 20 women. Overall, the vigilance and memory tasks decreased and increased heart rate, respectively, and in the vigilance tasks this effect was dependent on both time of day and sensory modality. The critical periods, those of greater stress, were the earliest and latest hours of the day and after lunch. Time of day also reversed the sign of CR (from deceleration to acceleration) in the visual vigilance task. We conclude that time of day has a significant effect on CR and that studies should take this factor into account. Authors should refrain from generalizing from results recorded at a single time of day.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a ubiquitous environmental toxicant from the Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) family has been implicated in toxicity of various organs. Several epidemiological studies have linked PFOA to different lung injuries and diseased conditions. However, the implication of PFOA in affecting epigenetic regulators and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways in the lung are unknown. The present work explores the accumulation of PFOA in lungs and changes in mRNA expression of DNA methylation regulator genes DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and ten-eleven translocation (Tets) along with the membrane proteins angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (Tmprss2) genes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. CD1 mice were orally exposed to 5 and 20 mg/kg/day PFOA for 10 days and the lung tissues were analyzed using LCMS, qPCR, and pyrosequencing techniques. PFOA was shown to accumulate in the lung tissues and increase in a dose-dependent manner. Dnmts and Tets were significantly downregulated upon at least one of the PFOA dosing concentration, whereas Ace2 and Tmprss2 show significant increase in their expression level. Further, CpG islands in the promotor region of Tmprss2 exhibited significant hypomethylation in PFOA treated groups, which supports its increased gene expression level. Current study reveals the implication of PFOA induced DNA methylation changes in lungs and their possible role in upregulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2. It is possible that increased expression of these membrane receptors due to PFOA exposure can lead to higher susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - Thermal decomposition products from a series of cellular synthetic polymers and several other polymers, synthetic or natural, were investigated. Evaluation of sensory irritating properties, physiological stress, asphyxiation, acute mortality, and histopathological changes due to the thermal decomposition products revealed a very wide range of potency among them. A classification system is proposed for making comparison to standard materials such as wood or fiberglass insulation and an acute lethal hazard system is presented for comparison of materials used for the same function, i.e., insulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retrospective and cross-sectional data suggest that vigorous exertion can trigger cardiac arrest or sudden death and that habitual exercise may diminish this risk. However, the role of physical activity in precipitating or preventing sudden death has not been assessed prospectively in a large number of subjects. METHODS: We used a prospective, nested case-crossover design within the Physicians' Health Study to compare the risk of sudden death during and up to 30 minutes after an episode of vigorous exertion with that during periods of lighter exertion or none. We then evaluated whether habitual vigorous exercise modified the risk of sudden death that was associated with vigorous exertion. In addition, the relation of vigorous exercise to the overall risk of sudden death and nonsudden death from coronary heart disease was assessed. RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up, 122 sudden deaths were confirmed among the 21,481 male physicians who were initially free of self-reported cardiovascular disease and who provided information on their habitual level of exercise at base line. The relative risk of-sudden death during and up to 30 minutes after vigorous exertion was 16.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 10.5 to 27.0; P<0.001). However, the absolute risk of sudden death during any particular episode of vigorous exertion was extremely low (1 sudden death per 1.51 million episodes of exertion). Habitual vigorous exercise attenuated the relative risk of sudden death that was associated with an episode of vigorous exertion (P value for trend=0.006). The base-line level of exercise was not associated with the overall risk of subsequent sudden death. CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data from a study of U.S. male physicians suggest that habitual vigorous exercise diminishes the risk of sudden death during vigorous exertion.

AB  - The interactions between polycarbonate (PC) packaging and different food simulants during microwave heating were evaluated by identifying the compounds migrating into aqueous, alcoholic and fatty food simulants. The migration of compounds, such as 9,9-dimethylxanthene and m-tert-butyl-phenol, from the PC package to ethanol and isooctane increased significantly during microwave heating as compared to conventional heating. The increase in migration can be explained by degradation caused by microwave heating and/or stronger food simulant interactions. Depending on the food simulant the migrants were quantified either by multiple headspace – solid-phase micro-extraction (MHS–SPME) or direct injection in combination with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. A partial least squares (PLS) regression model was developed to predict the extraction efficiency for headspace – solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) of food package migrants from the analyte properties. The most significant property for prediction of the enrichment factors was the octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) fibres were compared for the extraction of the migrants. High correlation was found between the PDMS and PDMS/DVB enrichment factors (R2 = 0.98), but the extraction by PDMS/DVB fibre was much more efficient compared to the extraction by PDMS fibre. The detection limits after SPME extraction by PDMS/DVB fibre were 1, 0.1 and 3 ng/L for 4-ethoxy-ethyl-benzoate, 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol and benzophenone, respectively.

RN  - Examined the effects of fatigue on three arm tasks. Fatigue achieved by using one arm to lift a weight (30% max isometric force). The three tasks were position matching, movement matching and vibration and done blindfolded. Found that muscle spindles are responsible for sense of movement, but sense of movement is not prone to disturbance from fatigue. Position on the other hand can be disturbed by muscle fatigue. Possible reason is that the sense of effort needed to resist gravity is used to provide information about position, and that the increased effort from fatigue produces the positional errors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the between-day reliability of the electromechanical delay (EMD) of selected neck muscles during the performance of maximal isometric contractions in five different directions. METHODS: Twenty-one physically active males participated in two testing sessions separated by seven to eight days. Using a custom-made fixed frame dynamometer, cervical force and surface electromyography (EMG) were recorded bilaterally from the splenius capitis, upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles during the performance of efforts in extension, flexion, left and right lateral bending, and protraction. The EMD was extracted using the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator. Reliability indices calculated for each muscle in each testing direction were: the difference in scores between the two testing sessions and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, the standard error of measurement (SEM) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: EMD values showed no evidence of systematic difference between the two testing sessions across all muscles and testing directions. The SEM for extension, flexion and lateral bending efforts ranged between 2.5 ms to 4.8 ms, indicating a good level of measurement precision. For protraction, SEM values were higher and considered to be imprecise for research and clinical purposes. ICC values for all muscles across all testing directions ranged from 0.23 to 0.79. CONCLUSION: EMD of selected neck muscles can be measured with sufficient precision for the assessment of neck muscle function in an athletic population in the majority of directions tested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of studies examining the role of cervical muscles on head-neck kinematics focused on musculoskeletal attributes (e.g. strength). Cervical neuromuscular response to perturbation may represent a divergent construct that has not been examined under various perturbation conditions. This study examined the association between cervical musculoskeletal attributes and cervical neuromuscular response of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) to perturbation. Furthermore, this study examined the effect of anticipation and preload on the SCM neuromuscular response. METHODS: Nineteen participants completed measurement of SCM muscle size, cervical flexion maximal voluntary isometric contraction, and the neuromuscular response of the SCM to cervical perturbation. Cervical perturbation was delivered by dropping a 1.59kg mass from a loading apparatus. The impulsive load was delivered under four conditions: (1) Anticipated perturbation with no preload (A-NP), (2) Unanticipated perturbation with no preload (U-NP), (3) Anticipated perturbation with preload (A-P), and (4) Unanticipated perturbation with preload (U-P). RESULTS: None of the cervical musculoskeletal attributes were correlated with the SCM cervical neuromuscular response. This study demonstrated significant effect of preloading and anticipation on baseline EMG amplitude and EMG onset latency for the SCM. Furthermore, there was a significant effect of preloading on average EMG response amplitude for the SCM. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study indicate that cervical neuromuscular response of the SCM is different from musculoskeletal attributes and is influenced by perturbation conditions. These findings provide conceptual support to examine the neuromuscular response of the SCM in mitigating head-neck kinematics.

AB  - Objective To assess the change in daily energy intake associated with pairwise compositional change in carbohydrate, fat and protein intake among US adults stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and weight status. Design Linear mixture model was performed to estimate the relationship between daily energy intake and macronutrient composition, adjusted for age and alcohol consumption, and accounting for survey design. Setting Study sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2010 waves. Subjects A total of 27 589 US adults aged 20 years and older were included in the study. Dietary macronutrient intake was calculated from 24 h dietary recall and BMI from objectively measured weight/height. Results Across all population subgroups, substituting protein or carbohydrate for fat and substituting protein for carbohydrate were associated with decreased daily energy intake, with the largest effect resulting from substituting protein for fat. A 1 % increase in the percentage of energy from protein substituted for a 1 % decrease in the percentage of energy from fat was associated with a decrease in daily energy intake of 268·2 (95 % CI 169·0, 367·4) kJ, 289·5 (95 % CI 215·9, 363·2) kJ and 293·7 (95 % CI 210·0, 377·4) kJ among normal-weight (18·5≤BMI, kg/m2<25·0), overweight (25·0≤BMI, kg/m2<30·0) and obese (BMI≥30·0 kg/m2) men, and 177·4 (95 % CI 130·5, 224·3) kJ, 188·7 (95 % CI 139·3, 238·1) kJ and 204·2 (95 % CI 158·2, 250·2) kJ among normal-weight, overweight and obese women, respectively. The relationship between macronutrient composition and daily energy intake varied substantially across sex, race/ethnicity and weight status. Conclusions Policies promoting higher daily protein intake at the expense of lower fat intake could be effective in reducing total energy intake among US adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exosomes derived from tumours are small vesicles released in vitro by tumour cell lines in culture supernatants. To assess the role of these exosomes in vivo, we examined malignant effusions for their presence. We also investigated whether these exosomes could induce production of tumour-specific T cells when pulsed with dendritic cells. METHODS: We isolated exosomes by ultracentrifugation on sucrose and D(2)O gradients of 11 malignant effusions. We characterised exosomes with Western blot analyses, immunoelectron microscopy, and in-vitro stimulations of autologous T lymphocytes. FINDINGS: Malignant effusions accumulate high numbers of membrane vesicles that have a mean diameter of 80 nm (SD 30). These vesicles have antigen-presenting molecules (MHC class-I heat-shock proteins), tetraspanins (CD81), and tumour antigens (Her2/Neu, Mart1, TRP, gp100). These criteria, including their morphological characteristics, indicate the similarities between these vesicles and exosomes. Exosomes from patients with melanoma deliver Mart1 tumour antigens to dendritic cells derived from monocytes (MD-DCs) for cross presentation to clones of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific to Mart1. In seven of nine patients with cancer, lymphocytes specific to the tumour could be efficiently expanded from peripheral blood cells by pulsing autologous MD-DCs with autologous ascitis exosomes. In one patient tested, we successfully expanded a restricted T-cell repertoire, which could not be recovered carcinomatosis nodules. INTERPRETATION: Exosomes derived from tumours accumulate in ascites from patients with cancer. Ascitis exosomes are a natural and new source of tumour-rejection antigens, opening up new avenues for immunisation against cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present review synthesized the available empirical evidence to provide support of the effectiveness and feasibility of exercise interventions for improving health and fitness of firefighters. METHODS: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before May 2018 were located using Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. RCTs involved 462 (18 Females) active-duty firefighters, an exercise intervention, and reported changes in health and/or fitness. Hedges' d effect sizes quantified the magnitude of the effects of exercise compared to control conditions. Aggregated mean effects for differential modes of exercise (aerobic exercise training (AET), resistance exercise training (RET), or combined (AET+RET) were also calculated. Random effects models were used for all analyses. RESULTS: Exercise significantly improved body fat percentage (Delta=0.52, [95% CI:0.16-0.88] z=2.81, p=0.005, k=4), aerobic capacity (Delta=1.20, [0.52-1.87] z=3.48, p=0.000, k=8), endurance (Delta=1.74, [0.94-2.53] z= 4.03, p=0.000, k=10), strength (Delta=1.27, [0.42-2.11] z=2.93, p=0.003, k=9), and power (Delta=1.02, [0.52-1.52] z=4.00, p=0.000, k=2). Specifically, RET improved body fat percentage (Delta=0.87, [0.38-1.36], z=3.47, p=0.000, k=2), aerobic capacity (Delta=3.06, [2.37-3.75], z=8.65, p=0.000, k=2), endurance (Delta=2.79, [1.48-4.09], z=4.19, p=0.000, k=6), strength (Delta=1.44, [0.49-2.39], z=2.97, p=0.002, k=8), and power (Delta=1.02, [0.52-1.52] z=3.99, p=0.000, k=2), while AET improved aerobic capacity (Delta=0.69, [0.24-1.15], z=3.01, p=0.000, k=3), and AET+RET improved aerobic capacity (Delta=0.52, [0.15-0.89] z=2.78, p=0.005, k=3) and endurance (Delta=0.44, [0.19-0.70] z=3.41, p=0.000, k=3). CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide evidence of the positive effects of exercise interventions, particularly RET, to improve outcomes of health and fitness associated with superior job performance and reduced risk of injury and CVD.

AB  - Slips, trips, and falls (STF) of firefighters may occur while traversing stationary obstacles. STF risk may be amplified by fatigue from firefighting and carrying an asymmetric load. Vertical and horizontal clearances of the lead (VCL, HCL) and trailing (VCT, HCT) foot and contact with a 30 cm obstacle were examined in 24 firefighters. We examined the impact on obstacle crossing performance due to three exercise protocols (treadmill walking or simulated firefighting in an environmental chamber, and simulated firefighting in a live-fire burn building) and carrying a hose load on the right shoulder. Post-activity fatigue resulted in significant decreases in HCL and VCT. Adding a hose load did not affect choice of lead/trailing foot, but did significantly decreased HCL and increased VCL. The hose load amplified acute fatigue effects by causing a sharper decrease in both VCL and VCT. Clearances were significantly impacted by interaction effects of exercise protocol type and acute fatigue. HCL decreased and VCL remained consistent following both simulated firefighting tasks, but HCL remained unchanged and VCL increased following the treadmill protocol. Contact errors increased with fatigue and load, and more errors occurred following simulated firefighting task protocols compared to treadmill walking. Our findings suggest that both acute fatigue and carrying an additional load can cause decrements in firefighter movement, which may place a firefighter at greater STF risk. Simulated firefighting testing protocols may have greater impact on movement performance than treadmill walking. Knowledge of these results may assist in the development of a reliable, laboratory based, and standardizable simulated firefighting exercise protocol.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this investigation was to examine day-to-day variations in metabolic measurements during submaximal exercise. Ten male subjects (five cyclists, five runners) randomly performed four cycling (CYC) and four running (RUN) trials. CYC trials were conducted on a bicycle ergometer at 100 W, 150 W, and 200 W; and RUN trials at treadmill velocities of 170, 200, and 230 m/min. Oxygen consumption ([Vdot]O 2 ) and minute ventilation ([Vdot]E) were recorded each minute by a computer-based system. Blood lactic acid (HLA) was sampled from an antecubital vein at 3-min post exercise. No significant differences (p > .05) were found between cyclists and runners in [Vdot]O 2 , [Vdot]E, or HLA at any workload. The mean coefficients of total variation (CVt = SD/[Xdot] · 100%) for [Vdot]O 2 were 4.42% (CYC) and 3.80% (RUN); mean CVt for [Vdot]E were 3.86% (CYC) and 4.82% (RUN); mean CVt for HLA were 13.4% (CYC) and 16.3% (RUN). Significant day-to-day differences (p < .05) were found in [Vdot]O 2 of cyclists during CYC and RUN, [Vdot]O 2 of runners while CYC and RUN, and [Vdot]E of cyclists during RUN. No significant day-to-day differences were observed for HLA. These data demonstrate the importance of considering [Vdot]O 2 , [Vdot]E, and HLA variability in reporting the results of experimental protocols.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an important public health problem throughout the developed world. Many important questions remain to be addressed in assessing exposure to these compounds. Because they are ubiquitous and highly volatile, special techniques must be applied in the analytical determination of VOCs. The analytical methodology chosen to measure toxicants in biological materials must be well validated and carefully carried out; poor quality assurance can lead to invalid results that can have a direct bearing on treating exposed persons. The pharmacokinetics of VOCs show that most of the internal dose of these compounds is quickly eliminated, but there is a fraction that is only slowly removed, and these compounds may bioaccumulate. VOCs are found in the general population at the high parts-per-trillion range, but some people with much higher levels have apparently been exposed to VOC sources away from the workplace. Smoking is the most significant confounder to internal dose levels of VOCs and must be considered when evaluating suspected cases of exposure.

AB  - Military personnel are required to carry heavy loads whilst marching; this load carriage represents a substantial component of training and combat. Studies in the literature mainly concentrate on physiological effects, with few biomechanical studies of military load carriage systems (LCS). This study examines changes in gait and posture caused by increasing load carriage in military LCS. The four conditions used during this study were control (including rifle, boots and helmet carriage, totalling 8 kg), webbing (weighing 8 kg), backpack (24 kg) and a light antitank weapon (LAW; 10 kg), resulting in an incremental increase in load carried from 8, 16, 40 to 50 kg. A total of 20 male soldiers were evaluated in the sagittal plane using a 3-D motion analysis system. Measurements of ankle, knee, femur, trunk and craniovertebral angles and spatiotemporal parameters were made during self-paced walking. Results showed spatiotemporal changes were unrelated to angular changes, perhaps a consequence of military training. Knee and femur ranges of motion (control, 21.1 degrees +/- 3.0 and 33.9 degrees +/- 7.1 respectively) increased (p < 0.05) with load (LAW, 25.5 degrees +/- 2.3 and 37.8 degrees +/- 1.5 respectively). The trunk flexed significantly further forward, confirming results from previous studies. In addition, the craniovertebral angle decreased (p < 0.001) indicating a more forward position of the head with load. It is concluded that the head functions in concert with the trunk to counterbalance load. The higher muscular tensions necessary to sustain these changes have been associated with injury, muscle strain and joint problems.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement, validity and intrarater reliability study. OBJECTIVES: (1) To confirm the validity and assess between-day test-retest reliability of cervical spine motion measurements made with the cervical range of motion (CROM) device in flexion, extension, bilateral rotation, and bilateral side flexion; (2) to provide meaningful information to clinicians about the standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable change for the CROM device. BACKGROUND: Range of motion is a common outcome measure used in the assessment of the cervical spine. The CROM device is one of the tools used to measure cervical range of motion in the clinical setting. However, its psychometric properties are not well established, especially for measurements taken on separate days. METHODS: Quasi-experimental design with 1 group comparison. Twenty healthy adults (9 men and 11 women) participated in this study. Cervical range of motion was simultaneously recorded with the CROM device and the Fastrak motion analysis system for all 6 cervical movements mentioned above. The CROM device was placed on the participant's head consistent with standard clinical procedures. Two Fastrak sensors were positioned with 1 on the forehead and 1 over the spinous process of the T6 vertebra. Test-retest reliability of measurements made with the CROM device was assessed, as well as its standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change, with measures taken on 2 separate days spaced 48 hours apart. RESULTS: Values obtained by the 2 measuring devices yielded Pearson correlation coefficients ranging between 0.93 and 0.98. Test-retest reliability of measurements of cervical range of motion using the CROM was found to be good, with ICCs ranging between 0.89 and 0.98. The standard errors of measurement across the 6 movements ranged from 1.6 degrees to 2.8 degrees and the minimal detectable changes across the 6 movements ranged from 3.6 degrees to 6.5 degrees . CONCLUSIONS: The measurements made with the CROM were shown to be reliable in all movement directions. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2010;40(5):318-323, Epub 12 March 2010. doi:10.2519/jospt.2010.3180.

AB  - Background: Movement disorders are chronic diseases with an increasing prevalence in old age. Because these disorders pose a major challenge to patients, families, and health care systems, there is a need for reliable data about the future number of affected people. Patients and Methods: We searched the literature to identify epidemiological studies to obtain age-specific prevalence data of movement disorders. We combined the age-specific prevalence data with population projections for Europe, the United States, and Canada. Results: Movement disorders will increase considerably between 2010 and 2050. The highest increase will be for dementia with Lewy bodies. In several countries, we project a near doubling of patients with PD. Conclusions: There will be a strong increase in the number of people affected by most movement disorders between 2010 and 2050. This increase will mostly depend on the future aging of populations in terms of their age structure and future life expectancy. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society

AB  - MuRF1 (TRIM63) is a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase and component of the ubiquitin proteasome system. MuRF1 is transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that cause muscle loss, in both rodents and humans, and is a recognized marker of muscle atrophy. In this study, we used in vivo electroporation to determine whether MuRF1 overexpression alone can cause muscle atrophy and, in combination with ubiquitin proteomics, identify the endogenous MuRF1 substrates in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of MuRF1 in adult mice increases ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, increases expression of genes associated with neuromuscular junction instability, and causes muscle atrophy. A total of 169 ubiquitination sites on 56 proteins were found to be regulated by MuRF1. MuRF1-mediated ubiquitination targeted both thick and thin filament contractile proteins, as well as, glycolytic enzymes, deubiquitinases, p62, and VCP. These data reveal a potential role for MuRF1 in not only the breakdown of the sarcomere but also the regulation of metabolism and other proteolytic pathways in skeletal muscle.

AB  - The cardiorespiratory and thermal responses of two intensities of treadmill exercise were compared for brief periods (12 min) in fire ensemble (FE) but without self contained breathing apparatus, and sports ensemble (SE), in a temperature environment. A further experiment explored the responses of subjects exercising in FE over a prolonged period (60 min). Eighteen male fire-fighters wearing either FE or SE walked on a level treadmill for 6 min at 5 km x h(-1) increasing to 7 km x h(-1) for 6 min. Following a recovery interval of 1 h, the exercise protocol was repeated in the second ensemble; the order of ensemble was balanced. Heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (Tre), VO2 max and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored continuously under both ensembles. At 7 km x h(-1), VO2 was significantly higher (p<0.05) in FE (36.1 and 39.9 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) than in SE and represented 74% VO2 max. There were no changes Tre. In experiment 2, following a rest interval of at least 36 h, eight subjects in FE walked on the treadmill at 6 km x h (gradient 10%) for 60 min also in temperate conditions, where HR, Tre and RPE were recorded at 10-min intervals. During the 60-min exercise in FE, HR reached 161 beats x min(-1) and Tre increased to 38.3 degrees C. Despite considerable subject discomfort, Tre remained below dangerous levels (38.4 degrees C). When RPE were compared with a physiological strain index (PSI) calculated from Tre and HR data over 60 min, there was no significant difference (p<0.05) with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.98. The results suggest that RPE and PSI are closely related when exercise is sufficiently prolonged or intense to elevate Tre and HR in fire-fighters wearing FE in temperate conditions. If further investigation confirms this relationship for hot humid conditions in which fire-fighters operate, then with training, it may provide individuals with a valid measure of dangerous levels of perceived heat strain.

AB  - To examine the effects of firefighters' self-contained breathing apparatus' (SCBA) weight and its harness design on the physiological and subjective responses, eight male students performed treadmill exercise under four conditions: the 8 kg firefighter protective clothing (PC) (Control), the PC + an 11 kg SCBA with an old harness (Test A), the PC + a 6.4 kg SCBA with an old harness (Test B) and the PC + a 6.4 kg SCBA with a new harness (Test C), at ambient temperatures (T(a)) of 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Besides highlighting the fact that a heavy SCBA had a significant effect on the oxygen consumption and metabolic rate, this experiment also found that in a T(a) of 32 degrees C, in particular, the combined effect of 4.7 kg lighter SCBA and new harness design could reduce metabolic rate and improved subjective muscle fatigue and thermal discomfort. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: An effort to alleviate the physiological and subjective burden of firefighters by reducing the weight of SCBA and by using the new harness design has provided satisfactory results in reduced oxygen consumption and in improved subjective responses in a hot air environment.

AB  - Study Design Whiplash injury is a prevalent and often destructive injury of the cervical column, which can lead to serious neck pain. Many approaches have been suggested for the treatment of whiplash injury, including anti-inflammatory drugs, manipulation, supervised exercise, and cervical collars. Cervical collars are generally divided into two groups: soft and rigid collars. Purpose The present study aimed to compare the effect of soft and rigid cervical collars on immobilizing head and neck motion. Overview of Literature Many studies have investigated the effect of collars on neck motion. Rigid collars have been shown to provide more immobilization in the sagittal and transverse planes compared with soft collars. However, according to some studies, soft and rigid collars provide the same range of motion in the frontal plane. Methods Twenty-nine healthy subjects aged 18–26 participated in this study. Data were collected using a three-dimensional motion analysis system and six infrared cameras. Eight markers, weighing 4.4 g and thickened 2 cm2 were used to record kinematic data. According to the normality of the data, a paired t-test was used for statistical analyses. The level of significance was set at α=0.01. Results All motion significantly decreased when subjects used soft collars (p<0.01). According to the obtained data, flexion and lateral rotation experienced the maximum (39%) and minimum (11%) immobilization in all six motions using soft collars. Rigid collars caused maximum immobilization in flexion (59%) and minimum immobilization in the lateral rotation (18%) and limited all motion much more than the soft collar. Conclusions This study showed that different cervical collars have different effects on neck motion. Rigid and soft cervical collars used in the present study limited the neck motion in both directions. Rigid collars contributed to significantly more immobilization in all directions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of muscle fatigue in active and inactive young adults on the kinematic and kinetic parameters of normal gait and obstacle crossing. Twenty male subjects were divided into active (10) and inactive (10), based on self-reported physical activity. Participants performed three trials of two tasks (normal gait and obstacle crossing) before and after a fatigue protocol, consisting of repeated sit-to-stand transfers until the instructed pace could no longer be maintained. MANOVAs were used to compare dependent variables with the following factors: physical activity level, fatigue and task. The endurance time in the fatigue protocol was lower for the inactive group. Changes of gait parameters with fatigue, among which increased step width and increased stride speed were the most consistent, were independent of task and physical activity level. These findings indicate that the kinematic and kinetic parameters of gait are affected by muscle fatigue irrespective of the physical activity level of the subjects and type of gait. Inactive individuals used a slightly different strategy than active individuals when crossing an obstacle, independently of muscle fatigue.

AB  - The occupation of firefighting is one that has repeatedly attracted the research interests of ergonomics. Among the activities encountered are attention to live fires, performing search and rescue of victims, and dealing with emergencies. The scientific literature is reviewed to highlight the investigative models used to contribute to the knowledge base about the ergonomics of firefighting, in particular to establish the multi-variate demands of the job and the attributes and capabilities of operators to cope with these demands. The job requires individuals to be competent in aerobic and anaerobic power and capacity, muscle strength, and have an appropriate body composition. It is still difficult to set down thresholds for values in all the areas in concert. Physiological demands are reflected in metabolic, circulatory, and thermoregulatory responses and hydration status, whilst psychological strain can be partially reflected in heart rate and endocrine measures. Research models have comprised of studying live fires, but more commonly in simulations in training facilities or treadmills and other ergometers. Wearing protective clothing adds to the physiological burden, raising oxygen consumption and body temperature, and reducing the time to fatigue. More sophisticated models of cognitive function compatible with decision-making in a fire-fighting context need to be developed. Recovery methods following a fire-fighting event have focused on accelerating the restoration towards homeostasis. The effectiveness of different recovery strategies is considered, ranging from passive cooling and wearing of cooling jackets to immersions in cold water and combinations of methods. Rehydration is also relevant in securing the safety of firefighters prior to returning for the next event in their work shift.

AB  - The accuracy of a computerized metabolic system, using inspiratory and expiratory methods of measuring ventilation, was assessed in eight male subjects. Gas exchange was measured at rest and during five stages on a cycle ergometer. Pneumotachometers were placed on the inspired and expired side to measure inspired (VI) and expired ventilation (VE). The devices were connected to two systems sampling expired O(2) and CO(2) from a single mixing chamber. Simultaneously, the criterion (Douglas bag, or DB) method assessed VE and fractions of O(2) and CO(2) in expired gas (FE(O(2)) and FE(CO(2))) for subsequent calculation of O(2) uptake (VO(2)), CO(2) production (VCO(2)), and respiratory exchange ratio. Both systems accurately measured metabolic variables over a wide range of intensities. Though differences were found between the DB and computerized systems for FE(O(2)) (both inspired and expired systems), FE(CO(2)) (expired system only), and VO(2) (inspired system only), the differences were extremely small (FE(O(2)) = 0.0004, FE(CO(2)) = -0.0003, VO(2) = -0.018 l/min). Thus a computerized system, using inspiratory or expiratory configurations, permits extremely precise measurements to be made in a less time-consuming manner than the DB technique.

AB  - Unaccustomed strenuous exercise can lead to muscle strength loss, inflammation and delayed-onset muscle soreness, which may be influenced by genetic variation. We investigated if a missense single nucleotide polymorphism (A>G, rs2275950 ) within the TRIM63 gene (encoding MuRF-1 and potentially affecting titin mechanical properties) was associated with the variable response to unaccustomed eccentric exercise. Sixty-five untrained, healthy participants (genotyped for rs2275950 : AA, AG, and GG) performed 120 maximal eccentric knee extensions (ECC) to induce muscle damage. Isometric and isokinetic maximal voluntary knee extension contractions (MVCs) and muscle soreness were assessed before, immediately after, and 48 h after ECC. AA homozygotes were consistently stronger [baseline isometric MVC: 3.23 ± 0.92 Nm/kg (AA) vs. 2.09 ± 0.67 Nm/kg (GG); P = 0.006] and demonstrated less muscle soreness over time ( P = 0.022) compared with GG homozygotes. This may be explained by greater titin stiffness in AA homozygotes, leading to intrinsically stronger muscle fibers that are more resistant to eccentric damaging contractions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excess body fat diminishes muscle protein synthesis rates in response to hyperinsulinemic-hyperaminoacidemic clamps. However, muscle protein synthetic responses after the ingestion of a protein-dense food source across a range of body mass indexes (BMIs) have not been compared. OBJECTIVE: We compared the myofibrillar protein synthetic response and underlying nutrient-sensing mechanisms after the ingestion of lean pork between obese, overweight, and healthy-weight adults. DESIGN: Ten healthy-weight [HW; BMI (in kg/m2): 22.7 +/- 0.4], 10 overweight (OW; BMI: 27.1 +/- 0.5), and 10 obese (OB; BMI: 35.9 +/- 1.3) adults received primed continuous l-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected before and after the ingestion of 170 g pork (36 g protein and 3 g fat) to assess skeletal muscle anabolic signaling, amino acid transporters [large neutral and small neutral amino acid transporters (LAT1, SNAT2) and CD98], and myofibrillar protein synthesis. RESULTS: At baseline, OW and OB groups showed greater relative amounts of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein than the HW group. Pork ingestion increased mTORC1 phosphorylation only in the HW group (P = 0.001). LAT1 and SNAT2 protein content increased during the postprandial period in all groups (time effect, P < 0.05). Basal myofibrillar protein synthetic responses were similar between groups (P = 0.43). However, myofibrillar protein synthetic responses (0-300 min) were greater in the HW group (1.6-fold; P = 0.005) after pork ingestion than in the OW and OB groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a diminished myofibrillar protein synthetic response to the ingestion of protein-dense food in overweight and obese adults compared with healthy-weight controls. These data indicate that impaired postprandial myofibrillar protein synthetic response may be an early defect with increasing fat mass, potentially dependent on altered anabolic signals, that reduces muscle sensitivity to food ingestion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02613767.

AB  - PURPOSES: This study investigated the impact of permanently tattooed skin on local sweat rate, sweat sodium concentration and skin temperature and determined whether tattoos alter the relationship between local and whole-body sweat sodium concentration. METHODS: Thirteen tattooed men (27 ± 6 years) completed a 1 h (66 ± 4% of [Formula: see text]) cycling trial at 32 °C, 35% relative humidity. Sweat rate and sweat sodium concentration were measured using the whole-body washdown and local absorbent patch techniques. Patches and skin-temperature probes were applied over the right/left thighs and tattooed/non-tattooed (contralateral) regions. RESULTS: Local sweat rates did not differ (p > 0.05) between the right (1.11 ± 0.38) and left (1.21 ± 0.37) thighs and the permanently tattooed (1.93 ± 0.82) and non-tattooed (1.72 ± 0.81 mg cm(-2) min(-1)) regions. There were no differences in local sweat sodium concentration between the right (58.2 ± 19.4) and left (55.4 ± 20.3) thighs and the permanently tattooed (73.0 ± 22.9) and non-tattooed (70.2 ± 18.9 mmol L(-1)) regions. Difference in local skin temperature between the right and left thighs (- 0.043) was similar to that between the permanently tattooed and non-tattooed (- 0.023 °C) regions. Prediction of whole-body sweat sodium concentration for the permanently tattooed (41.0 ± 6.7) and the non-tattooed (40.2 ± 5.3 mmol L(-1)) regions did not differ. CONCLUSION: Permanent tattoos do not alter local sweat rate, sweat sodium concentration or local skin temperature during moderate-intensity cycling exercise in a warm environment. Results from a patch placed over a tattooed surface correctly predicts whole-body sweat sodium concentration from an equation developed from a non-tattooed region.

AB  - Background: Labeled noise reduction (NR) data presented by manufacturers are considered one of the main challenging issues for occupational experts in employing hearing protection devices (HPDs). This study aimed to determine the actual NR data of typical HPDs using the objective fit testing method with a microphone in real ear (MIRE) method. Methods: Five available commercially earmuff protectors were investigated in 30 workers exposed to reference noise source according to the standard method, ISO 11904-1. Personal attenuation rating (PAR) of the earmuffs was measured based on the MIRE method using a noise dosimeter (SVANTEK, model SV 102). Results: The results showed that means of PAR of the earmuffs are from 49% to 86% of the nominal NR rating. The PAR values of earmuffs when a typical eyewear was worn differed statistically (p < 0.05). It is revealed that a typical safety eyewear can reduce the mean of the PAR value by approximately 2.5 dB. The results also showed that measurements based on the MIRE method resulted in low variability. The variability in NR values between individuals, within individuals, and within earmuffs was not the statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study could provide local individual fit data. Ergonomic aspects of the earmuffs and different levels of users experience and awareness can be considered the main factors affecting individual fitting compared with the laboratory condition for acquiring the labeled NR data. Based on the obtained fit testing results, the field application of MIRE can be employed for complementary studies in real workstations while workers perform their regular work duties.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to quantify the metabolic demand of simulated shipboard fire-fighting procedures currently practised by men and women in the Royal Navy (RN) and to identify a minimum level of cardiovascular fitness commensurate with satisfactory performance. Thirty-four males (M) and 15 females (F) volunteered as subjects for this study (n = 49). Maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) and heart rate (fcmax) of each subject was assessed during a standardized treadmill test. During the main trials, volunteers were randomly assigned to complete several 4-min simulated shipboard fire-fighting tasks (boundary cooling (BC), drum carry (DC), extinguisher carry (EC), hose run (HR), ladder climb (LC)), at a work rate that was endorsed as a minimum acceptable standard. Heart rate (fc) and oxygen uptake (V̇O2) were recorded at 10-s intervals during rest, exercise and recovery. Participants completed all tasks within an allocated time with the exception of the DC task, where 11 subjects (all females) failed to maintain the endorsed work rate. The DC task elicited the highest (p&lt;0.01) group mean peak metabolic demand (PMD) in males (43 ml min-1 kg-1) and females (42 ml min-1 kg-1) who were able to maintain the endorsed work rate. The BC task elicited the lowest PMD (23 ml min-1 kg-1), whilst the remaining three tasks elicited a remarkably similar PMD of 38-39 ml min-1 kg-1. The human endurance limit while wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) dictates that RN personnel are only able to fire-fight for 20-30 min, while wearing a full fire-fighting ensemble (FFE) and performing a combination of the BC, HR and LC tasks, which have a group mean metabolic demand of 32.8 ml min-1 kg-1. Given that in healthy subjects fire-fighting can be sustained at a maximum work intensity of 80% V̇O2max when wearing SCBA for this duration, it is recommended that all RN personnel achieve a V̇O2max of 41 ml min-1 kg-1 as an absolute minimum standard. Subjects with a higher V̇O2max than the above quoted minimum are able to complete the combination of tasks listed with greater metabolic efficiency and less fatigue.

AB  - The 3-D gait analysis of military load carriage is not well represented, if at all, within the available literature. This study collected 3-D lower limb kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters in order to assess the subsequent impact of carrying loads in a backpack of up to 32 kg. Results showed the addition of load significantly decreased the range of motion of flexion/extension of the knee and pelvic rotation. Also seen were increases in adduction/abduction and rotation of the hip and pelvis tilt. No changes to ankle kinematics were observed. Alterations to the spatiotemporal parameters of gait were also of considerable interest, namely, an increase in double support and a decrease in preferred stride length as carried load increased. Analysing kinematics during military or recreational load carriage broadens the knowledge regarding the development of exercise-related injuries, while helping to inform the human-centred design process for future load carrying systems. The importance of this study is that limited available research has investigated 3-D lower limb joint kinematics when carrying loads.

AB  - Load carriage is an inevitable part of military life both during training and operations. Loads carried are frequently as high as 60% bodyweight, and this increases injury risk. In the military, load is carried in a backpack (also referred to as a Bergen) and webbing, these combined form a load carriage system (LCS). A substantial body of literature exists recording the physiological effects of load carriage; less is available regarding the biomechanics. Previous biomechanical studies have generally been restricted to loads of 20% and 40% of bodyweight, usually carried in the backpack alone. The effect of rifle carriage on gait has also received little or no attention in the published literature. This is despite military personnel almost always carrying a rifle during load carriage. In this study, 15 male participants completed 8 conditions: military boot, rifle, webbing 8 and 16 kg, backpack 16 kg and LCS 24, 32 and 40 kg. Results showed that load added in 8 kg increments elicited a proportional increase in vertical and anteroposterior ground reaction force (GRF) parameters. Rifle carriage significantly increased the impact peak and mediolateral impulse compared to the boot condition. These effects may be the result of changes to the vertical and horizontal position of the body's centre of mass, caused by the restriction of natural arm swing patterns. Increased GRFs, particularly in the vertical axis, have been positively linked to overuse injuries. Therefore, the biomechanical analysis of load carriage is important in aiding our understanding of injuries associated with military load carriage.

AB  - In clinical measurement comparison of a new measurement technique with an established one is often needed to see whether they agree sufficiently for the new to replace the old. Such investigations are often analysed inappropriately, notably by using correlation coefficients. The use of correlation is misleading. An alternative approach, based on graphical techniques and simple calculations, is described, together with the relation between this analysis and the assessment of repeatability.

AB  - Skeletal muscle adapts to decreases in activity and load by undergoing atrophy. To identify candidate molecular mediators of muscle atrophy, we performed transcript profiling. Although many genes were up-regulated in a single rat model of atrophy, only a small subset was universal in all atrophy models. Two of these genes encode ubiquitin ligases: Muscle RING Finger 1 (MuRF1), and a gene we designate Muscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx), the latter being a member of the SCF family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Overexpression of MAFbx in myotubes produced atrophy, whereas mice deficient in either MAFbx or MuRF1 were found to be resistant to atrophy. These proteins are potential drug targets for the treatment of muscle atrophy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a powered ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) that provides dorsiflexor and plantar flexor assistance at the ankle can improve walking endurance of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Short-term intervention. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=16) with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS and daily use of a prescribed custom unilateral passive AFO. INTERVENTIONS: Three 6-minute walk tests (6MWTs), 1 per footwear condition: shoes (no AFO), prescribed passive AFO, and portable powered AFO (PPAFO). Assistive devices were worn on the impaired limb. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distance walked and metabolic cost of transport were recorded during each 6MWT and compared between footwear conditions. RESULTS: Each participant completed all three 6MWTs within the experimental design. PPAFO use resulted in a shorter 6MWT distance than did a passive AFO or shoe use. No differences were observed in metabolic cost of transport between footwear conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The current embodiment of this PPAFO did not improve endurance walking performance during the 6MWT in a sample of participants with gait impairment due to MS. Further research is required to determine whether expanded training or modified design of this powered orthosis can be effective in improving endurance walking performance in persons with gait impairment due to MS.

AB  - Skeletal muscle repair is essential for effective remodeling, tissue maintenance, and initiation of beneficial adaptations post-eccentric exercise. A series of well characterized events, such as recruitment of immune cells and activation of satellite cells, constitute the basis for muscle regeneration. However, details regarding the fine-tuned regulation of this process in response to different types of injury are open for investigation. Muscle-resident non-myogenic, non-satellite stem cells expressing conventional mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers, have the potential to significantly contribute to regeneration given the role for bone marrow-derived MSCs in whole body tissue repair in response to injury and disease. The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight a regulatory role for Pnon-satellite stem cells in the process of skeletal muscle healing post-eccentric exercise. The non-myogenic, non-satellite stem cell fraction will be defined, its role in tissue repair will be briefly reviewed, and recent studies demonstrating a contribution to eccentric exercise-induced regeneration will be presented.

AB  - To study the influence of weight carrying on the cardiorespiratory system during dynamic exercise (walking) four conditions, i.e., rest, and treadmill exercise at 25, 50, and 75% of the individual VO2max, were combined with weight carrying of 10, 20, and 30 kg. In all experiments oxygen uptake, heart rate and pulmonary ventilation were measured. For each dynamic exercise condition and for the rest condition regression lines are calculated showing the relation between weight load an oxygen uptake, heart rate and pulmonary ventilation. From the slopes of these regression lines it can be seen that in rest (standing position) weight carrying does not influence oxygen uptake, heart rate and pulmonary ventilation. In dynamic exercise oxygen uptake, heart rate and pulmonary ventilation increase linearly with the amount of weight carried. To a large extent this increase is independent of the dynamic work load. In this study it was found that each kilogram extra weight increases oxygen uptake with 33.5 ml/min, heart rate with 1.1 beats/min and pulmonary ventilation with 0.6 1/min. In dyanmic work for loads higher than 50% of VO2max the relationship between weight carried and pulmonary ventilation is no longer a linear one. For the subjects studied it is assumed that oxygen consumption per kilogram weight is not different for body weight or extra weight carried.

AB  - Firefighters are known to be exposed to a wide variety of combustion products during operational and training firefighting activities. However, the potential for exposure to diesel exhaust emissions, recently classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, also exists within the fire station environment. In this study, concentrations of diesel particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been measured in the engine bays, duty offices and dormitory areas of eight fire stations in Queensland, Australia. Operation of fire appliances and mechanical equipment during start of shift checks were found to contribute more strongly to overall engine bay diesel particulate matter concentrations than the number of fire appliance departures and returns. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found to be transported further into fire station living environments than diesel particulate matter. This study highlights a number of potential strategies for reducing firefighter exposures to components of diesel engine exhaust in the fire station environment.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms by which individuals subjected to environmental heat stress either recover or develop heat-related complications are not well understood. We analysed the changes in blood mononuclear gene expression patterns in human volunteers exposed to extreme heat in a sauna (temperature of 75.7 ± 0.86 °C). Our analysis reveals that expression changes occur rapidly with no significant increase in core temperature and continue to amplify one hour after the end of heat stress. The reprogramed transcriptome was predominantly inhibitory, as more than two-thirds of the expressed genes were suppressed. The differentially expressed genes encoded proteins that function in stress-associated pathways; including proteostasis, energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and cell death, and survival. The transcriptome also included mitochondrial dysfunction, altered protein synthesis, and reduced expression of genes -related to immune function. The findings reveal the human transcriptomic response to heat and highlight changes that might underlie the health outcomes observed during heat waves.

AB  - Several observations support the notion that integration of neck proprioceptive input is impaired in cervical dystonia (CD). An example is the inconsistent or opposite to normal effect of lateral neck muscle vibration on body rotation during stepping. We hypothesized that lateral neck vibration produces abnormal responses also in a static task. Normal subjects and patients with CD stood quietly with eyes closed, without or with vibration applied to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and center of foot pressure and body sway were recorded by a dynamometric platform. Patients had a larger than normal sway under control condition. They showed little or no postural responses to vibration. When body tilt occurred, it was rarely in the frontal plane as in normal subjects, but in the sagittal plane. No relationship existed between vibration-induced tilt during stance and body rotation during stepping. Therefore, in CD, proprioceptive neck input is less used for the construction of the postural vertical during quiet stance than it is used for the definition of the subjective straight ahead during a dynamic task.

Here, the results are given of an analysis of survey data estimating the numbers and types of disabled people who are mobile beyond their own homes, the degree of assistance they require, the percentage of the total mobile population they constitute, and the extent to which they are involved in sports and leisure pursuits. This information can be used to derive working estimates of the prevalence and nature of disability among building populations when characterizing building occupancies, a prerequisite to fire engineering.

AB  - The Canadian Forces Firefighter Physical Fitness Maintenance Evaluation (FF PFME) requires firefighters in full fire-protective ensemble, including self-contained breathing apparatus, to correctly complete 10 work-related tasks on a measured and calibrated course. Fitness for duty is inferred from completion time of the course. We hypothesized that completion time may be dependent on pacing strategy and day-to-day fluctuations in biological function. To examine variability in performance, 20 females and 31 males (mean +/- SD; age, 27.6 +/- 10.5 years; height, 176.7 +/- 8.3 cm; mass, 77.3 +/- 13.4 kg) were familiarized with the FF PFME and then completed the test on 6 separate days. Pre-test behaviours (e.g., sleep, diet) and test conditions (e.g., calibration, time of day) were consistent. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in completion time between tests 1 and 6 (18.7%) and between all sequential pairs (e.g., tests 1 and 2). There was also a small but significant increase in the fraction of total test time for task completion and a corresponding decrease in the time to transition between tasks. The performance improvements cannot be explained by differences in effort (heart rate and perceived exertion). Coefficient of variation for tests 1, 2, and 3 was 7% and for tests 4, 5, and 6 was 2.6%. The results indicate the importance of practice on performance and the potential for false-positive or false-negative decision errors if biological variability is not taken into account.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized vesicles containing nucleic acid and protein cargo that are released from a multitude of cell types and have gained significant interest as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Human serum is a rich source of readily accessible EVs; however, the separation of EVs from serum proteins and non-EV lipid particles represents a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the most commonly used isolation techniques, either alone or in combination, for the isolation of EVs from 200 µl of human serum and their separation from non-EV protein and lipid particles present in serum. The size and yield of particles isolated by each method was determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, with the variation in particle size distribution being used to determine the relative impact of lipoproteins and protein aggregates on the isolated EV population. Purification of EVs from soluble protein was determined by calculating the ratio of EV particle count to protein concentration. Finally, lipoprotein particles co-isolated with EVs was determined by Western blot analysis of lipoprotein markers APOB and APOE. Overall, this study reveals that the choice of EV isolation procedure significantly impacts EV yield from human serum, together with the presence of lipoprotein and protein contaminants.

AB  - This study analyzed diurnal variations in oxygen (O(2)) uptake kinetics and efficiency during a moderate cycle ergometer exercise. Fourteen physically active diurnally active male subjects (age 23+/-5 yrs) not specifically trained at cycling first completed a test to determine their ventilatory threshold (T(vent)) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)); one week later, they completed four bouts of testing in the morning and evening in a random order, each separated by at least 24 h. For each period of the day (07:00-08:30 h and 19:00-20:30 h), subjects performed two bouts. Each bout was composed of a 5 min cycling exercise at 45 W, followed after 5 min rest by a 10 min cycling exercise at 80% of the power output associated with T(vent). Gas exchanges were analyzed breath-by-breath and fitted using a mono-exponential function. During moderate exercise, the time constant and amplitude of VO(2) kinetics were significantly higher in the morning compared to the evening. The net efficiency increased from the morning to evening (17.3+/-4 vs. 20.5+/-2%; p<0.05), and the variability of cycling cadence was greater during the morning than evening (+34%; p<0.05). These findings suggest that VO(2) responses are affected by the time of day and could be related to variability in muscle activity pattern.

AB  - Resistance exercise training (RET) is widely used to increase muscle mass in athletes and also aged/cachectic populations. However, the time course and metabolic and molecular control of hypertrophy remain poorly defined. Using newly developed deuterium oxide (D2O)-tracer techniques, we investigated the relationship between long-term muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and hypertrophic responses to RET. A total of 10 men (23 +/- 1 yr) undertook 6 wk of unilateral (1-legged) RET [6 x 8 repetitions, 75% 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) 3/wk], rendering 1 leg untrained (UT) and the contralateral, trained (T). After baseline bilateral vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies, subjects consumed 150 ml D2O (70 atom percentage; thereafter 50 ml/wk) with regular body water monitoring in saliva via high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer:isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Further bilateral VL muscle biopsies were taken at 3 and 6 wk to temporally quantify MPS via gas chromatography:pyrolysis:isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Expectedly, only the T leg exhibited marked increases in function [i.e., 1-RM/maximal voluntary contraction (60 degrees )] and VL thickness (peaking at 3 wk). Critically, whereas MPS remained unchanged in the UT leg (e.g., approximately 1.35 +/- 0.08%/d), the T leg exhibited increased MPS at 0-3 wk (1.6 +/- 0.01%/d), but not at 3-6 wk (1.29 +/- 0.11%/d); this was reflected by dampened acute mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling responses to RET, beyond 3 wk. Therefore, hypertrophic remodeling is most active during the early stages of RET, reflecting longer-term MPS. Moreover, D2O heralds promise for coupling MPS and muscle mass and providing insight into the control of hypertrophy and efficacy of anabolic interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the blood benzene levels resulting from environmental and occupational benzene exposure. METHODS: Benzene in venous blood was measured in 243 nonoccupationally exposed subjects ("normal" people) and in 167 workers occupationally exposed to benzene. All exposed workers gave blood samples at the end of the work shift and on the following morning before resuming work. Blood benzene was assayed by gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry. Occupational benzene exposure was monitored by environmental personal samplers and measured by GC analysis. RESULTS: The mean occupational benzene exposure for all 167 workers studied was 186 ng/l (58 ppb; range 5 1535 ng/l, 2-500 ppb). Overall, the mean blood benzene level of all workers was 420 ng/1 at the end of the shift and 287 ng/l on the morning thereafter. The blood benzene levels measured the morning after turned out to be significantly lower (t=3.6; P < 0.0001) than those measured at the end of the shift. The mean blood benzene level of the 243 "normal" subjects was 165 ng/l, which was significantly lower than that measured in the workers on the morning thereafter (t=5.8: P < 0.0000001). The mean blood benzene concentration was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers in both the general population (264 versus 123 ng/l) and in the exposed workers. In the group of nonsmoking workers, whose workplace exposure to benzene was lower than 100 ng/l, blood benzene levels were similar (210-202 ng/l) to those measured in the nonsmoking general population (165 ng/l). End-of-shift blood benzene correlated significantly with environmental exposure (y=0.91x + 251; r=0.581; n=162; P < 0.00001). Finally, there was also a significant correlation between blood benzene measured at the end of the shift and that determined on the morning thereafter (y=0.45x + 109; r=0.572; n=156; P < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: Nonsmoking workers occupationally exposed to benzene at environmental levels lower than 100 ng/l (mean 35 ng/l) and the nonsmoking general population exposed to ubiquitous benzene pollution have similar blood benzene concentrations. This suggests that it is impossible to distinguish between occupational and environmental exposure when the benzene level in the workplace is less than 100 ng/l.

AB  - Cognitive control of physical activity and sedentary behavior is receiving increased attention in the neuroscientific and behavioral medicine literature as a means of better understanding and improving the self-regulation of physical activity. Enhancing individuals’ cognitive control capacities may provide a resilient means to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. First, this paper reviews emerging evidence of the antecedence of cognitive control abilities in successful self-regulation of physical activity, and in precipitating self-regulation failure that predisposes to sedentary behavior. We then highlight the brain networks that may underpin the cognitive control and self-regulation of physical activity, including the default mode network, prefrontal cortical networks and brain regions and pathways associated with reward. We then discuss research on cognitive training interventions that document improved cognitive control and that suggest promise of influencing physical activity regulation. Key cognitive training components likely to be the most effective at improving self-regulation are also highlighted. The review concludes with suggestions for future research.

AB  - First responders often wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection from on-the-job hazards. While PPE ensembles offer individuals protection, they limit one's ability to thermoregulate, and can place the wearer in danger of heat exhaustion and higher cardiac stress. Automatically monitoring thermal-work strain is one means to manage these risks, but measuring core body temperature (Tc) has proved problematic. An algorithm that estimates Tc from sequential measures of heart rate (HR) was compared to the observed Tc from 27 US soldiers participating in three different chemical/biological training events (45-90 min duration) while wearing PPE. Hotter participants (higher Tc) averaged (HRs) of 140 bpm and reached Tc around 39 °C. Overall the algorithm had a small bias (0.02 °C) and root mean square error (0.21 °C). Limits of agreement (LoA ± 0.48 °C) were similar to comparisons of Tc measured by oesophageal and rectal probes. The algorithm shows promise for use in real-time monitoring of encapsulated first responders. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: An algorithm to estimate core temperature (Tc) from non-invasive measures of HR was validated. Three independent studies (n = 27) compared the estimated Tc to the observed Tc in humans participating in chemical/ biological hazard training. The algorithm’s bias and variance to observed data were similar to that found from comparisons of oesophageal and rectal measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein consumed after resistance exercise increases postexercise muscle protein synthesis rates. To date, dairy protein has been studied extensively, with little known about the capacity of other protein-dense foods to augment postexercise muscle protein synthesis rates. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare protein digestion and absorption kinetics, postprandial amino acid availability, anabolic signaling, and the subsequent myofibrillar protein synthetic response after the ingestion of milk compared with beef during recovery from resistance-type exercise. DESIGN: In crossover trials, 12 healthy young men performed a single bout of resistance exercise. Immediately after cessation of exercise, participants ingested 30 g protein by consuming isonitrogenous amounts of intrinsically l-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine-labeled beef or milk. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at rest and after exercise during primed continuous infusions of l-[ring-(2)H5]phenylalanine and l-[ring-3,5-(2)H2]tyrosine to assess protein digestion and absorption kinetics, plasma amino acid availability, anabolic signaling, and subsequent myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in vivo in young men. RESULTS: Beef protein-derived phenylalanine appeared more rapidly in circulation compared with milk ingestion (P < 0.001). The availability of phenylalanine during the 5-h postexercise period tended to be higher after beef (64% +/- 3%) ingestion than after milk ingestion (57% +/- 3%; P = 0.08). Both beef and milk ingestion were followed by an increase in the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 70-kDa S6 protein kinase 1 during postexercise recovery. Milk ingestion increased myofibrillar protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than did beef ingestion during the 0- to 2-h postexercise phase (P = 0.013). However, the increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis rates did not differ between milk and beef ingestion during the entire 0- to 5-h postexercise phase (P = 0.114). CONCLUSIONS: Both milk and beef ingestion augment the postexercise myofibrillar protein synthetic response in young men, with a stronger stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis during the early postprandial stage after milk ingestion. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01578590.

AB  - It is often recommended that heavier training intensities ( approximately 70%-80% of maximal strength) be lifted to maximize muscle growth. However, we have reported that intensities as low as 30% of maximum strength, when lifted to volitional fatigue, are equally effective at stimulating muscle protein synthesis rates during resistance exercise recovery. This paper discusses the idea that high-intensity contractions are not the exclusive driver of resistance exercise-induced changes in muscle protein synthesis rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the cardiovascular and hemostatic effects of fire suppression and postexposure active cooling. METHODS: Forty-four firefighters were evaluated before and after a 12-minute live-fire drill. Next, 50 firefighters performing the same drill were randomized to undergo postfire forearm immersion in 10 °C water or standard rehabilitation. RESULTS: In the first study, heart rate and core body temperature increased and serum C-reactive protein decreased but there were no significant changes in fibrinogen, sE-selectin, or sL-selectin. The second study demonstrated an increase in blood coagulability, leukocyte count, factors VIII and X, cortisol, and glucose, and a decrease in plasminogen and sP-selectin. Active cooling reduced mean core temperature, heart rate, and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Live-fire exposure increased core temperature, heart rate, coagulability, and leukocyte count; all except coagulability were reduced by active cooling.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of firefighter exposure reduction interventions. Methods: Fireground interventions included use of self-contained breathing apparatus by engineers, entry team wash down, contaminated equipment isolation, and personnel showering and washing of gear upon return to station. Urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites (PAH-OHs) were measured after structural fire responses before and after intervention implementation. Separately, infrared sauna use following live-fire training was compared to standard postfire care in a randomized trial. Results: The fireground interventions significantly reduced mean total urinary postfire PAH-OHs in engineers (−40.4%, 95%CI −63.9%, −2.3%) and firefighters (−36.2%, 95%CI −56.7%, −6.0%) but not captains (−11.3% 95%CI −39.4%, 29.9%). Sauna treatment non-significantly reduced total mean PAH-OHs by −43.5% (95%CI −68.8%, 2.2%). Conclusions: The selected fireground interventions reduced urinary PAH-OHs in engineers and firefighters. Further evaluation of infrared sauna treatment is needed.

AB  - The International Association of Athletics Federations recognizes the importance of nutritional practices in optimizing an Athlete’s well-being and performance. Although Athletics encompasses a diverse range of track-and-field events with different performance determinants, there are common goals around nutritional support for adaptation to training, optimal performance for key events, and reducing the risk of injury and illness. Periodized guidelines can be provided for the appropriate type, amount, and timing of intake of food and fluids to promote optimal health and performance across different scenarios of training and competition. Some Athletes are at risk of relative energy deficiency in sport arising from a mismatch between energy intake and exercise energy expenditure. Competition nutrition strategies may involve pre-event, within-event, and between-event eating to address requirements for carbohydrate and fluid replacement. Although a “food first” policy should underpin an Athlete’s nutrition plan, there may be occasions for the judicious use of medical supplements to address nutrient deficiencies or sports foods that help the athlete to meet nutritional goals when it is impractical to eat food. Evidence-based supplements include caffeine, bicarbonate, beta-alanine, nitrate, and creatine; however, their value is specific to the characteristics of the event. Special considerations are needed for travel, challenging environments (e.g., heat and altitude); special populations (e.g., females, young and masters athletes); and restricted dietary choice (e.g., vegetarian). Ideally, each Athlete should develop a personalized, periodized, and practical nutrition plan via collaboration with their coach and accredited sports nutrition experts, to optimize their performance.

AB  - Many expert sporting bodies now support a pragmatic acceptance of the use of performance supplements which have passed a risk:benefit analysis of being safe, effective, and permitted for use, while also being appropriate to the athlete's age and maturation in their sport. However, gaining evidence of the performance benefits of these supplements is a process challenged by the scarcity of research in relation to the number of available products, and the limitations of the poor quality of some studies. While meta-analyses and systematic reviews can help to provide information about the general use of performance supplements, the controlled scientific trial provides the basis on which these reviews are undertaken, as well as an opportunity to address more specific questions about supplement applications. Guidelines for the design of studies include the choice of well-trained athletes who are familiarized with performance tasks that have been chosen on their basis of their known reliability and validity. Supplement protocols should be chosen to maximize the likely benefits, and researchers should also make efforts to control confounding variables, while keeping conditions similar to real-life practices. Performance changes should be interpreted in light of what is meaningful to the outcomes of sporting competition. Issues that have been poorly addressed to date include the use of several supplements in combination and the use of the same supplement over successive events, both within a single, and across multiple competition days. Strategies to isolate and explain the variability of benefits to individuals are also a topic for future investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether measures of physiologic function and fundamental movement are predictive of injury in firefighters during a training academy. PARTICIPANTS: 108 firefighter trainees enrolled in the training academy. METHODS: Baseline measures of physical performance and fundamental movement patterns were obtained in firefighters entering a training academy to determine predictors of injury. The physical performance measures were standardized tests of individual maximum performance on a set of four different total body tests and one firefighter specific performance test, the tower test. Measurements of fundamental movement patterns consisted of the seven tests of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) along with the composite score.Performance on each of the individual tests was examined to determine if any of the variables were predictive of injury. RESULTS: ROC curve analysis established that a FMS cut score of </= 14 was able to discriminate between those at a greater risk for injury. In addition, the deep squat and push up component of the FMS were statistically significant predictors of injury status along with the sit and reach test. CONCLUSIONS: Injury in firefighters during academy can be predicted by baseline measures of musculoskeletal movement and physiology.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the peak sagittal plane joint angles and joint moments of the lower extremity during the deep squat (DS) movement of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) to assess differences between the classifications (1,2,3). Twenty-eight participants volunteered for the study and were screened to assess their FMS score on the DS task. All participants underwent a quantitative movement analysis performing the FMS DS movement at a self-selected speed. The participants in Group 3 exhibited greater dorsiflexion excursion compared to those in Group 1. Participants in Group 3 had greater peak knee flexion and knee flexion excursion than those in Group 2 who exhibited more than the participants in Group 1. Group 3 also exhibited a greater peak knee extension moment compared to Group 1. At the hip, Groups 3 and 2 exhibited greater peak hip flexion, hip flexion excursion and peak hip extension moment compared to Group 1. Thus, it appears that individuals who score differently on the deep squat as determined by the FMS exhibit differences in mechanics that may be beneficial in assessing strategies for interventions. Future research should assess how fundamental changes in mobility and stability independently affect DS performance.

AB  - Large artery stiffness assessment has been an integral part of the SphygmoCor technology since 1998. Aortic stiffness is approximated with non-invasive measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, with improvements made with time to make the assessment procedure quicker and more user independent. Also standard in the devices is the ability to reliably calculate the central aortic waveform shape from a peripheral pressure waveform from either the brachial or radial artery. This waveform contains much information beyond peak and trough (systolic and diastolic pressure). Relative waveform features such as the augmentation index, wave reflection magnitude, reflection time index, and subendocardial viability ratio are parameters that are influenced by the stiffness of systemic arteries. This article briefly describes these parameters related to large artery stiffness and provides reference to validation and repeatability studies relative to the clinical use of the SphygmoCor devices. It is beyond the scope to review here the 424 original research articles that have employed SphygmoCor devices in measuring arterial stiffness. Instead, the method of measurement across the devices is described, including tonometry, volumetric displacement through cuff placement around limbs, and ambulatory monitoring. Key population and subpopulation studies are cited where the average stiffness parameter progression with age and gender, as measured by SphygmoCor devices, is quantified in the healthy and general population. Finally, with reference to guidelines from working groups on arterial stiffness and hypertension, the clinical utility of large artery stiffness measurement is discussed in the context of the arterial stiffness parameters provided by the SphygmoCor systems.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the effect of exercise-induced muscle damage on knee extensor muscle strength during isometric, concentric and eccentric actions at 1.57 rad x s(-1) and vertical jump performance under conditions of squat jump, countermovement jump and drop jump. The eight participants (5 males, 3 females) were aged 29.5+/-7.1 years (mean +/- s). These variables, together with plasma creatine kinase (CK), were measured before, 1 h after and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after a bout of muscle damaging exercise: 100 barbell squats (10 sets x 10 repetitions at 70% body mass load). Strength was reduced for 4 days (P< 0.05) but no significant differences (P> 0.05) were apparent in the magnitude or rate of recovery of strength between isometric, concentric and eccentric muscle actions. The overall decline in vertical jump performance was dependent on jump method: squat jump performance was affected to a greater extent than countermovement (91.6+/-1.1% vs 95.2+/-1.3% of pre-exercise values, P< 0.05) and drop jump (95.2+/-1.4%, P< 0.05) performance. Creatine kinase was elevated (P < 0.05) above baseline 1 h after exercise, peaked on day 1 and remained significantly elevated on days 2 and 3. Strength loss after exercise-induced muscle damage was independent of the muscle action being performed. However, the impairment of muscle function was attenuated when the stretch-shortening cycle was used in vertical jumping performance.

AB  - Alveolar gas transfer over a given breath (i) was determined in ten subjects at rest and during steady-state cycling at 60, 90 or 120 W as the sum of volume of gas transferred at the mouth plus the changes of the alveolar gas stores. This is given by the gas fraction (FA) change at constant volume plus the volume change (deltaVAi) at constant fraction i.e. VAi-1(FAi-FAi-1)+FAi x deltaVAi, where VAi-1 is the end-expiratory volume at the beginning of the breath. These quantities, except for VAi-1, can be measured on a single-breath (breath-by-breath) basis and VAi-1 set equal to the subject's functional residual capacity (FRC, Auchincloss model). Alternatively, the respiratory cycle can be defined as the interval elapsing between two equal expiratory gas fractions in two successive breaths (Gronlund model G). In this case, Ft1 = Ft2 and thus the term VAi-1 (FAi-FAi-1) vanishes. In the present study, average alveolar O2 uptake (VO2,A) and CO2 output (VCO2,A) were equal in both approaches whereby the mean signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was 40% larger in G. Other approaches yield steady state S/N values equal to that obtained in G, although they are based on the questionable assumption that the inter-breath variability of alveolar gas transfer is minimal. It is concluded that the only promising approach for assessing "true" single-breath alveolar gas transfer is that originally proposed by Gronlund.

AB  - Information concerning the validity and reliability of commercial on-line gas analysis systems is limited. The aim of this study was to provide a comparison of the validity and reliability of three on-line systems (Oxycon Alpha, Oxycon Pro and Pulmolab EX670) with that of Douglas bags. Two separate studies were conducted. In study 1, the three gas analysis systems were compared with Douglas bags using a metabolic simulator over four increases in ventilation. In study 2, ten subjects were split into equal groups exercising at 100 W or 150 W for 85 min on three separate occasions. Each system was used twice per visit. Study 1 demonstrated that the Oxycon Alpha and Douglas bags produced similar respiratory values over all levels of ventilation. The Oxycon Pro tended to slightly overestimate mean expiratory flow (V(E) ), oxygen uptake ( VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at the higher ventilations. The Pulmolab produced large overestimations at all ventilations for and RER (up to 26.3% away from expectations), whilst values for, and were slightly underestimated at higher ventilations (up to 7.5% from expectations). The results of study 2 support the findings of study 1, with the Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha producing similar results compared to Douglas bags for, and RER. The coefficients of variation for and measured using Douglas bags, Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha were 3.3-5.1%, 4.7-7.0% and 4.5-6.3%, respectively, whilst that for the Pulmolab was highly variable (26.8-45.8%). The exercise study showed the Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha to be both valid and reliable on-line systems for the measurement of parameters of respiration, at least at workloads up to 150 W.

AB  - The giant myofibrillar protein titin contains within its C-terminal region a serine-threonine kinase of unknown function. We have identified a novel muscle specific RING finger protein, referred to as MURF-1, that binds in vitro to the titin repeats A168/A169 adjacent to the titin kinase domain. In myofibrils, MURF-1 is present within the periphery of the M-line lattice in close proximity to titin's catalytic kinase domain, within the Z-line lattice, and also in soluble form within the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screens with MURF-1 as a bait identified two other highly homologous MURF proteins, MURF-2 and MURF-3. MURF-1,2,3 proteins are encoded by distinct genes, share highly conserved N-terminal RING domains and in vitro form dimers/heterodimers by shared coiled-coil motifs. Of the MURF family, only MURF-1 interacts with titin repeats A168/A169, whereas MURF-3 has been reported to affect microtubule stability. Association of MURF-1 with M-line titin may potentially modulate titin's kinase activity similar to other known kinase-associated proteins, whereas differential expression and heterodimerization of MURF1, 2 and 3 may link together titin kinase and microtubule-dependent signal pathways in striated muscles.

AB  - The duration of the effect of a short-course (1-mo twice-daily) supplementation of moderate amounts (2.28 g) of n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (FA) on platelet lipid composition and aggregation was compared with that of olive oil (3 g/d) supplementation in 14 healthy volunteers. The FA preparation employed contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) in a ratio of 1:1.4. A marked rise (p <0.05) in the plasma and platelet content of EPA and DHA, and minimal changes in the content of arachidonic acid (AA) were documented at withdrawal of the n-3 FA supplementation. EPA/AA and DHA/AA ratios in platelet phospholipids showed that the FA accumulation persisted 8-12 wks after stopping the supplementation (p <0.05). The aggregation of platelets in response to collagen or ADP, and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) formation were impaired at withdrawal. The impaired aggregation lasted 8-12 weeks (p always <0.05), whereas TXB2 formation returned to basal values 4 weeks after stopping the n-3 supplementation. No correlation was found between impaired aggregation and TXB2 formation. In contrast, the impaired sensitivity to ADP (p = 0.036) and, to a lesser extent, to collagen (p = 0.068) were related to changes in the intracellular pH (pHi) of the Na+/H+ reverse transport. No changes in platelet composition or function were observed either during or following olive oil supplementation. These results document a long-lasting impairment of platelet sensitivity to ADP and collagen; changes in the pHi values of the Na+/H+ reverse transport, and a simultaneous persistent accumulation of EPA and DHA in platelet phospholipids, after stopping a short-course dietary supplementation of moderate amounts of n-3 fatty acid ethyl esters.

AB  - Occupational slips, trips and falls on the same level (STFL) result in substantial injuries worldwide. This paper summarises the state of science regarding STFL, outlining relevant aspects of epidemiology, biomechanics, psychophysics, tribology, organisational influences and injury prevention. This review reaffirms that STFL remain a major cause of workplace injury and STFL prevention is a complex problem, requiring multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted approaches. Despite progress in recent decades in understanding the mechanisms involved in STFL, especially slipping, research leading to evidence-based prevention practices remains insufficient, given the problem scale. It is concluded that there is a pressing need to develop better fall prevention strategies using systems approaches conceptualising and addressing the factors involved in STFL, with considerations of the full range of factors and their interactions. There is also an urgent need for field trials of various fall prevention strategies to assess the effectiveness of different intervention components and their interactions. Practitioner Summary: Work-related slipping, tripping and falls on the same level are a major source of occupational injury. The causes are broadly understood, although more attention is needed from a systems perspective. Research has shown preventative action to be effective, but further studies are required to understand which aspects are most beneficial.

AB  - To ascertain whether fatigue perception is linked to exertion dyspnea and/or to an impaired cardiorespiratory response during walk, 11 patients (8 females, age range 21-46 years) with multiple sclerosis (MS) and mild disability underwent the 6-min walk test. Ten healthy subjects (7 females, age range 25-49 years) were studied, as a control group. Patients did not differ from controls in spirometry, lung volumes and respiratory muscle strength. There was a significant difference in walk distance between patients and controls (P<0.001), but not in dyspnea perception. In patients, the walk distance significantly related to disability score (P<0.01), but not to fatigue. Compared to controls, patients had a significant decrease in oxygen pulse during walk (P<0.05) and a significant increase in the ventilatory equivalent of CO2 both at baseline and during walk (P<0.05). The relative contribution of both the tidal volume and of the ratio of inspiratory to total breathing cycle duration to the increase in minute ventilation during walk was significantly less in patients, as compared to controls (P<0.05). We conclude that in MS patients with mild disability, fatigue and exertion dyspnea are different sensations without any link and a peripheral limitation during walk can occur.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the effect of boot weight and sole flexibility on spatiotemporal gait characteristics and physiological responses of firefighters in negotiating obstacles. BACKGROUND: Falls and overexertion are the leading causes of fire ground injuries and fatalities among firefighters. There have been few in-depth studies conducted to evaluate the risk factors of falls and overexertion associated with firefighter boots. METHOD: For the study, 13 female and 14 male firefighters, while wearing full turnout clothing and randomly assigned boots, walked for 5 min while stepping over obstacles. The independent variables included boot weight, sole flexibility, gender, and task duration. Spatiotemporal measures of foot trajectories and toe clearance were determined. Minute ventilation, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heart rate were measured. RESULTS: Increased boot weight was found to significantly reduce trailing toe clearance when crossing the 30-cm obstacle. Significant increases in lateral displacement of the foot were found near the end of the 5-min walk compared with the beginning of the task Increased boot weight significantly increased oxygen consumption. There were significant decreases in oxygen consumption for more flexible soles. CONCLUSION: Firefighters were more likely to trip over obstacles when wearing heavier boots and after walking for a period of time. Boot weight affected metabolic variables (5% to 11% increases per 1-kg increase in boot weight), which were mitigated by sole flexibility (5% to 7% decrease for more flexible soles). APPLICATION: This study provides useful information for firefighters and boot manufacturers in boot selection and design for reducing falls and overexertion.

AB  - The physical demands of firefighting are evident, and a high level of physical fitness is required to perform the job safely. Despite the clear need for adequate physical fitness, the majority of firefighters (FF) remain unfit for duty. Regular exercise is an effective strategy to prevent/attenuate multiple health risks, as well as improve health and job performance. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between physical fitness (i.e., cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance) and performance on the Academy FF Challenge (AFC). METHODS: During the first (week 1) and last (week 7) weeks of the FF academy, FF recruits’ (n=54; 26.76±4.16 yrs; 100% male) physical fitness and FF ability were assessed. Physical fitness was assessed via cardiovascular endurance (estimated VO2max via 1.5-mile run time) and muscular endurance (60-second sit-ups and push-ups and Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) bench press), while FF ability was assessed via total completion time on the AFC (Keiser Sled, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus maze, victim drag, hose advance, equipment carry, and ladder set-up). RESULTS: Physical fitness predicted significant variance in FF ability at Week 1 (R2=0.48; P<0.001) and Week 7 (R2=0.47; P<0.001) after accounting for age and BMI. Specifically, cardiovascular endurance accounted for 28.9% (FΔ (3, 50) =22.83) and 36.4% (FΔ (3, 50) =28.70) unique variance, while muscular endurance accounted for 11.4% (FΔ (6, 47) =3.45) and 10.2% (FΔ (6, 47) =3.02) unique variance on FF ability at week 1 and 7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Firefighting is a challenging occupation that requires these individuals to be in peak physical condition. Targeting FFs early in their careers and highlighting the importance of fitness is extremely vital to developing healthy, safe, and efficient FFs. By better understanding the relationship between physical fitness and firefighting ability, exercise specialists, researchers, and physicians may be able to better prescribe exercise in this population.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the impact resistance of organic ophthalmic lens materials. METHODS: Plano power CR39, Phoenix, Trilogy, and polycarbonate lenses with various scratch-resistant (SR) and/or antireflection (AR) coatings were obtained in batches of 40 units. All lenses had a nominal thickness of 2 mm. Half of each batch was conditioned following the European Standard EN 168 protocol for the test of resistance to UVR (exposed group). The remaining lenses comprised an unexposed group for that combination of lens substrate and coating treatment. Each group was subjected to ballistic impact with 6-mm steel balls following the ZEST protocol to determine its mean breakage velocity. The difference in mean breakage velocity between exposed and unexposed groups of each combination of lens substrate and coating was assessed for statistical significance. RESULTS: Exposed uncoated CR39 showed a reduction in fracture velocity of 10.3 m/s whereas CR39 with ultra hard coat had a reduction of 3.5 m/s and CR39 with AR and SR coating had a reduction of 4.1 m/s. Scratch-resistant coated Phoenix had a reduction of 4.8 m/s whereas AR-coated Phoenix had a reduction of 3.7 m/s. The corresponding reductions for Trilogy were 3.9 and 17.8 m/s. All differences were significant at the p level of less than 0.05. Although we were unable to break unexposed SR-coated polycarbonate lenses with our test apparatus, exposed SR-coated polycarbonate had a mean breakage velocity of 142 m/s. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that extended UVR exposure causes a significant reduction in the impact resistance of the ophthalmic lens substrates commonly used for occupational eye protectors. Protective lenses that have been exposed to high levels of UVR for extended periods should be replaced regularly to maintain optimal impact protection, even if they do not show visible damage owing to wear and tear.

AB  - This study evaluates the usefulness of body mass index (BMI) as a preventive screening tool for general health and duty fitness status among firefighters. Two major BMI categorization methods were used: (1) "standard" [low (< 27), medium (> or = 27 < 30), high (> 30)]; and (2) WHO [(normal (< 25), overweight (> or = 25 < 30), obese (> or = 30 < 39), morbidly obese (> or = 39)]. Using the "standard" categorization, nearly 60% of individuals had medium or high BMI's; using the World Health Organization categorization, 80.7% of individuals were found to be overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. Statistically significant, inverse correlation between BMI and each of the following parameters was noted: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, VO2max, METS, and total cholesterol. Inconsistent or statistically insignificant correlation was found between BMI and HDL, Chol/HDL ratio, triglycerides, FVC% predicted, and FEV1 second% predicted. Findings were similar to previous studies of such correlates. BMI continues to prove useful as a screening tool and may be useful in identifying individual firefighters for health and fitness intervention measures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is well known that firefighters face serious risk to their health and safety in the performance of their duties. To determine whether individuals who work as firefighters sustain occupational noise-induced hearing losses, we evaluated results of hearing tests completed by firefighters and compared them with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed groups of individuals. DESIGN: The results of annual audiometric testing and a related questionnaire collected as part of a company-wide hearing conservation program were obtained from two large urban fire departments. The records from 12,609 tests conducted over an 11-year period were evaluated. Hearing levels obtained from the tests were compared with age-matched control populations from an American national standard, and a longitudinal study comparing the rate of hearing loss to that expected due to presbycusis alone was conducted. RESULTS: Comparisons of the data to the national standard indicated that firefighters do not exhibit excessive loss of hearing compared with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed control subjects. The longitudinal study that examined the regression of firefighters' hearing with age compared with the expected presbycasic regression function indicated that the hearing of firefighters in the study declined over the 7-year period at a rate that was less than that expected due to age alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study indicate that firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise-induced hearing loss, even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise. The results are consistent with the findings but not the conclusions of several other studies of firefighters' hearing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Higher intakes of red and processed meat are associated with poorer health outcomes and negative environmental impacts. Drawing upon a population survey the present paper investigates meat consumption behaviours, exploring perceived impacts for human health, animal welfare and the environment. DESIGN: Structured self-completion postal survey relating to red and processed meat, capturing data on attitudes, sustainable meat purchasing behaviour, red and processed meat intake, plus sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. SETTING: Urban and rural districts of Nottinghamshire, East Midlands, UK, drawn from the electoral register. SUBJECTS: UK adults (n 842) aged 18-91 years, 497 females and 345 males, representing a 35.6 % response rate from 2500 randomly selected residents. RESULTS: Women were significantly more likely (P60 years) were more likely to hold positive attitudes towards animal welfare (P<0.01). Less than a fifth (18.4 %) of the sample agreed that the impact of climate change could be reduced by consuming less meat, dairy products and eggs. Positive attitudes towards animal welfare were associated with consuming less meat and a greater frequency of 'higher welfare' meat purchases. CONCLUSIONS: Human health and animal welfare are more common motivations to avoid red and processed meat than environmental sustainability. Policy makers, nutritionists and health professionals need to increase the public's awareness of the environmental impact of eating red and processed meat. A first step could be to ensure that dietary guidelines integrate the nutritional, animal welfare and environmental components of sustainable diets.

AB  - Firefighters are required to use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for respiratory protection when engaged in a variety of firefighting duties. While the SCBA provides crucial respiratory support and protection, it is also cumbersome and heavy, thus adding to the physical work performed by the firefighter. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the low profile SCBA prototype to a standard SCBA, as assessed by the objective and subjective measures of mobility and comfort, time of donning/doffing, as well as by acquiring user feedback on SCBA design features during field activities. The results of the present study indicated that the prototype SCBA was rated as a significant improvement over the standard SCBA in the areas of range of motion (ROM), mobility, comfort, induction of fatigue, interaction with protective clothing, and operability when worn over a standard firefighter ensemble, while performing a series of International Association of Fire Fighters Fire Ground Survival Program training exercises. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: A prototype SCBA was evaluated and compared with a standard SCBA, focusing on the objective and subjective measures of mobility and comfort during field activities. Feedback from end users was collected during the evaluation. The findings of the present study can be used for improving the system design and overall performance of new prototype SCBAs.

AB  - Firefighter turnout gear and equipment protect the wearer against external hazards but, unfortunately, restrict mobility. The aim of this study was to determine the ease of mobility and comfort while wearing a new prototype firefighter ensemble (PE) with additional chemical/biological hazard protection compared to a standard ensemble (SE) by measuring static and dynamic range of motion (ROM), job-related tasks, and comfort. Eight healthy adults (five males, three females), aged 20-40 years, participated in this study. The study consisted of two repeated phases, separated by five uses of the ensembles. Subjects randomly donned either the SE or PE in either dry or wet conditions on separate days. In each phase, five tests were carried out as follows: baseline (non-ensemble), SE-dry, SE-wet, PE-dry, and PE-wet. There was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of wrist flexion for PE-dry condition compared to the same SE-dry condition. Donning the PE took 80 s longer than the SE in phase 1, this difference disappeared in phase 2. There was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in post-test comfort wearing the PE compared to the SE. The data collected in this study suggest that, in spite of design features to enhance chemical/biological hazard protection, the PE design does not decrease the wearer's overall functional mobility compared to the SE. However, subjects seem to be more comfortable wearing the SE compared to the PE. These overall findings support the need for a comprehensive ergonomic evaluation of protective clothing systems to ascertain human factors issues.

AB  - Many studies have shown that fire fighter turnout gear and equipment may restrict mobility. The restriction of movement is usually due to a decrease in range of motion (ROM). It is important to know how much the decrease in ROM affects performance. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of fire fighter protective ensembles on mobility and performance by measuring static and dynamic range of motion (ROM) and job-related tasks. Eight healthy adults (5 males, 3 females), aged 20-40 years, participated in this study. The study consisted of measuring a battery of motions and fire fighter specific tasks while wearing a standard fire fighter ensemble (SE) or regular light clothing (baseline or BL). Several BL ROM tests were significantly (p < 0.05) different from the SE test, including a decrease in shoulder flexion, cervical rotation and flexion, trunk lateral flexion, and stand and reach. There was a significant decrease in time from SE to baseline performing the one-arm search task and object lift. These overall findings support the need for a comprehensive ergonomic evaluation of protective clothing systems to ascertain human factors issues. The development of a Standard Ergonomics Test Practice for further use in laboratories that conduct personal protective systems evaluations using human test subjects is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the use of two active cooling devices with passive cooling in a moderate-temperature ( approximately 22 degrees C) environment on heart rate (HR) and core temperature (T(c)) recovery when applied to firefighters following 20 minutes of fire suppression. METHODS: Firefighters (23 men, two women) performed 20 minutes of fire suppression at a live-fire evolution. Immediately following the evolution, the subjects removed their thermal protective clothing and were randomized to receive forearm immersion (FI), ice water perfused cooling vest (CV), or passive (P) cooling in an air-conditioned medical trailer for 30 minutes. Heart rate and deep gastric temperature were monitored every 5 minutes during recovery. RESULTS: A single 20-minute bout of fire suppression resulted in near-maximal mean +/- standard deviation HR (175 +/- 13 b min(-1), P; 172 +/- 20 b.min(-1), FI; 177 +/- 12 b.min(-1), CV) when compared with baseline (p < 0.001), a rapid and substantial rise in T(c) (38.2 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees , P; 38.3 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees , FI; 38.3 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees , CV) compared with baseline (p < 0.001), and body mass lost from sweating of nearly 1 kilogram. Cooling rates ( degrees C.min) differed (p = 0.036) by device, with FI (0.05 +/- 0.04) providing higher rates than P (0.03 +/- 0.02) or CV (0.03 +/- 0.04), although differences over 30 minutes were small and recovery of body temperature was incomplete in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: During 30 minutes of recovery following a 20-minute bout of fire suppression in a training academy setting, there is a slightly higher cooling rate for FI and no apparent benefit to CV when compared with P cooling in a moderate temperature environment.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-Lower-body fatigue can lead to a decline in vertical jump (VJ) and balance performance due to decreased motor control and coordination. The purpose is to determine the effects of lower-body fatigue on VJ and balance performance. Twenty-four recreationally trained individuals participated in a single 1-hour familiarization and testing session. Participants were familiarized with balance, countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ), and static vertical jump (SVJ) using the Vertec. Three trials of static and dynamic balance tests were completed. Three trials of a SVJ and CMVJ were completed in a randomized order pre/post fatigue protocol. Three trials of double-leg and single-leg tests were performed. Dependent t tests analyzed differences between pre/post fatigue protocol for jumping and balance measures. There was a significant (p < 0.001) difference between pre/post measures for SVJ-H (height), CMVJ-H, and CMVJ peak power (PP). Results showed an interaction (p < 0.05) for group by time for CMVJ-H, CMVJ-peak force (PF), SVJ-PF, and SVJ-PP. There were no main effects (p > 0.05) for time or group for SVJ-rate of velocity development and SVJ-impact force (IF). There were no interactions, time effects, and group effects for balance variables (p > 0.05). Bosco protocol decreased VJ height and PF in SVJ, and VJ height and PF, IF, peak velocity, and PP for CMVJ potentially due to decreased muscle control, coordination, and force-generating capacity after fatigue. Practitioners should consider fatiguing effects on individuals performing jumping motions but it seems that fatigue has no effect on balance.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to implement a new method for assessing the ventilatory thresholds from heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. ECG, VO2, VCO2, and VE were collected from eleven well-trained subjects during an incremental exhaustive test performed on a cycle ergometer. The "Short-Term Fourier Transform" analysis was applied to RR time series to compute the high frequency HRV energy (HF, frequency range: 0.15 - 2 Hz) and HF frequency peak (fHF) vs. power stages. For all subjects, visual examination of ventilatory equivalents, fHF, and instantaneous HF energy multiplied by fHF (HF.fHF) showed two nonlinear increases. The first nonlinear increase corresponded to the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) and was associated with the first HF threshold (T(RSA1) from fHF and HFT1 from HF.fHF detection). The second nonlinear increase represented the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) and was associated with the second HF threshold (T(RSA2) from fHF and HFT2 from HF.fHF detection). HFT1 , T(RSA1), HFT2, and T(RSA2) were, respectively, not significantly different from VT1 (VT1 = 219 +/- 45 vs. HFT1 = 220 +/- 48 W, p = 0.975; VT1 vs. T(RSA1) = 213 +/- 56 W, p = 0.662) and VT2 (VT2 = 293 +/- 45 vs. HFT2 = 294 +/- - 48 W, p = 0.956; vs. T(RSA2) = 300 +/- 58 W, p = 0.445). In addition, when expressed as a function of power, HFT1, T(RSA1), HFT2, and T(RSA2) were respectively correlated with VT1 (with HFT1 r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001; with T(RSA1) r2 = 0.48, p < 0.05) and VT2 (with HFT2 r2 = 0.97, p < 0.001; with T(RSA2 )r2 = 0.79, p < 0.001). This study confirms that ventilatory thresholds can be determined from RR time series using HRV time-frequency analysis in healthy well-trained subjects. In addition it shows that HF.fHF provides a more reliable and accurate index than fHF alone for this assessment.

AB  - Since 1992 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) annual survey of occupational injuries and illnesses (SOII) has collected data on occupational injuries and illnesses involving 1 or more days away from work (DAW). However, to date, the BLS has not published a comprehensive set of cross-tabulated part of body (BP), nature of injury or illness (NOI), and exposure/event (EE) data. To improve the understanding of the causes of disabling occupational morbidity in the United States, the present study used a special data call and data reduction strategy to identify the leading BP-NOI-EE combinations for DAW cases by frequency, incidence rate, and severity (median DAW) for 1996. The results indicated that the majority of injury and illness morbidity reported by the BLS was related to musculoskeletal conditions of either gradual or sudden onset and traumatic injuries of sudden onset. In particular, traumatic injuries from sudden events such as falls resulted in the most disabling cases. The results indicate that the occupational morbidity identified in the SOII requires interventions focused on overexertion and falls, as well as more traditional injury prevention approaches. The BLS can improve the utility of the system by adding provisions for a second event code to the coding structure and by improving direct access to these data for occupational health and safety professionals.

AB  - This study examined the accuracy and reliability of the MedGraphics VO2000 (VO2000) portable metabolic system and the ParvoMedics TrueOne 2400 (TrueOne 2400) metabolic cart against the criterion Douglas bag (DB) method. Ten healthy males (age 20 +/- 1.7 years) had their gas exchange variables measured at rest and during cycling at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 W. Each stage was 10-12 min. For half of the stage gas exchange was measured with the DB and TrueOne 2400 simultaneously and for the other half of the stage gas exchange was measured with the VO2000. The testing was performed on two separate days and the order in which the equipment was used in each stage was randomized. Reliability between days for V (E) (CV 7.3-8.8%) was similar among devices, however, for VO2, and VCO2 the VO2000 (CV 14.2-15.8%) was less reliable compared to the DB (CV 5.3-6.0%) and TrueOne 2400 (CV 4.7-5.7%). The TrueOne 2400 was not significantly different from the DB at rest or any work rate for V (E), VO2, or VCO2 (P > or = 0.05). The VO2000 was significantly different from the DB for V (E) at 50-100 W, VO2 at rest and 100-250 W, and VCO2 at rest and 200-250 W (all, P < 0.05). The TrueOne 2400 provides accurate and reliable results for the measurement of gas exchange variables. The VO2000 portable metabolic system was less reliable for measuring VO2 and VCO2 and generally overestimates VO2 at most cycling work rates. Further research is needed to confirm the results found with the VO2000.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the effects of self-selected work activity on energy expenditure, water turnover, and thermal strain during wildland fire suppression. A secondary aim was to contrast current data with data collected 15 years ago using similar methods to determine whether job demands have changed. METHODS: Participants (n=15, 26+/-3 years, 179+/-6 cm, 78.3+/-8.6 kg) were monitored for 3 days for total energy expenditure, water turnover, core and chest skin temperature, physical activity, and heart rate. Participants arrived to the mobile laboratory each morning, submitted a nude weight, ingested a temperature transmitter, provided a urine sample, and were equipped with a physiological and activity monitor. Participants completed live wildland fire suppression during their work shifts. RESULTS: Mean core temperature was 37.6 degrees +/-0.2 degrees C, mean chest skin temperature was 34.1 degrees +/-1.0 degrees C, mean heart rate was 112+/-13 beats/min, and the mean physiological strain index score was 3.3+/-1.0. Wildland firefighters spent 49+/-8%, 39+/-6%, and 12+/-2% in the sedentary, light, and moderate-vigorous intensity categories, respectively. The mean total energy expenditure was 19.1+/-3.9 MJ/d, similar to 1997 (17.5+/-6.9 MJ/d). The mean water turnover in 2012 was 9.5+/-1.7 L/d, which was higher (P<.05) compared with 1997-98 (7.0+/-1.7 L/d). CONCLUSIONS: Wildland firefighters do not induce consistently high cardiovascular and thermal strain while completing arduous work in a hot environment despite fairly high chest skin temperatures. The total energy expenditure in the current study suggests job demands are similar to those of 15 years ago, while the increased water turnover may reflect a change in drinking habits.

AB  - The volatile, water soluble trichloroethylene (TCE) is a hazardous industrial waste and could lead to various health problems, including cancer, neuropathy, cardiovascular defects, and immune diseases. Toxicological studies taking use of in vitro and in vivo models have been conducted to understand the biological impacts of TCE at the genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and signaling levels. The epigenetic aberrations induced by TCE have also been reported in a number of model organisms, while a detailed mechanistic elucidation is lacking. In this study we uncover an unreported mechanism accounting for the epigenetic toxicity due to TCE exposure by monitoring the single-molecule dynamics of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) in living cells. TCE-induced global DNA hypomethylation could be partly attributed to the disrupted Dnmt3a-DNA association. By analyzing the components of detached Dnmt3a, we found that the Dnmt3a oligomers (e.g., dimer, trimer, and high-order oligomers) dissociated from heterochromatin in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure. Thereafter the diminished DNA-binding affinity of Dnmt3a resulted in a significant decrease in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) under both acute high-dosage and chronic low-dosage TCE exposure. The resulting DNA demethylation might also be contributed by the elevated expression of ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) enzymes and reformed cysteine cycle. Besides the global effect, we further identified that a group of heterochromatin-located, cancer-related microRNAs (miRNAs) experienced promoter demethylation upon TCE exposure.

AB  - During ascending evacuation in long stairs, there is reason to believe that factors such as physical exhaustion, human behaviour and the mental state will influence the possibility of satisfactory evacuation and affect walking speed and flow rate of people. Based on these hypotheses, a research project was initiated. As a part of the project, an initial literature study has been conducted. The literature study has made an attempt to summarize the most important findings of previous research about physical exhaustion and design of stairs for ascending evacuation in long stairs. This paper presents the findings from the literature study.

AB  - We describe a new respiratory valve system with minimal dead space, which allows measurement of ventilation and oxygen uptake during swimming. The device offers considerable advantages in efficiency and accuracy over current equipment, and can be used in conjunction either with a miniaturized telemetry system for oxygen uptake measurement or with a conventional system. The valve has a low airflow resistance, a small dead space (15 ml), and an electrically operating, closed-circuit pump to remove excess water from the expiratory tube. The external form and the buoyancy of the valve have been hydrostatically and hydrodynamically designed to reduce drag and to ensure a correct mass in the water. To obtain this result a very sophisticated material, carbon fibre, has been utilized. Our studies showed that this respiratory system is ideal for obtaining valid and reliable values of oxygen uptake during swimming, even at high speed and in endurance swimming tests.

AB  - Objectives To examine mortality patterns and cancer incidence in a pooled cohort of 29 993 US career firefighters employed since 1950 and followed through 2009. Methods Mortality and cancer incidence were evaluated by life table methods with the US population referent. Standardised mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios were determined for 92 causes of death and 41 cancer incidence groupings. Analyses focused on 15 outcomes of a priori interest. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the potential for significant bias. Results Person-years at risk totalled 858 938 and 403 152 for mortality and incidence analyses, respectively. All-cause mortality was at expectation (SMR=0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01, n=12 028). There was excess cancer mortality (SMR=1.14, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.18, n=3285) and incidence (SIR=1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.12, n=4461) comprised mainly of digestive (SMR=1.26, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.34, n=928; SIR=1.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, n=930) and respiratory (SMR=1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.17, n=1096; SIR=1.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.24, n=813) cancers. Consistent with previous reports, modest elevations were observed in several solid cancers; however, evidence of excess lymphatic or haematopoietic cancers was lacking. This study is the first to report excess malignant mesothelioma (SMR=2.00, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.49, n=12; SIR=2.29, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.19, n=35) among US firefighters. Results appeared robust under differing assumptions and analytic techniques. Conclusions Our results provide evidence of a relation between firefighting and cancer. The new finding of excess malignant mesothelioma is noteworthy, given that asbestos exposure is a known hazard of firefighting.

AB  - Twenty-six physical performance variables were assessed on 100 professional fire fighters and correlated against timed measures of five sequentially performed fire fighting tasks and against fractionated heart rates collected during performance of the fire fighting tasks via Holter monitoring of the ECG. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that two factors, physical work capacity and resistance to fatigue, accounted for the fractionated time and heart rate data. The first factor, influenced heavily by the average intra-task heart rate (L = 0.94) and by the approximately equal weights for the five simulated tasks (-0.53 less than L less than -0.36), reflected the fact that relatively high muscular strength and endurance, coupled with a near maximal aerobic capacity effort, were required to complete the simulated tasks. The battery of physical performance variables best predicting the first factor (R2 = 0.63) included maximal heart rate, sit-ups, grip strength, age, and submaximal oxygen pulse. The second factor (R2 = 0.39), most heavily loaded by the simulated rescue (L = 0.70) and chopping tasks (L = 0.42), appeared to represent an ability to complete all tasks quickly by exhibiting a resistance to fatigue brought on by the demands of the earlier tasks. The battery of physical performance variables best predicting the second factor included lean body weight, maximal heart rate, final treadmill grade, age, and percent fat. This study demonstrated that physiological factors related to the performance of occupational tasks can be identified and measured.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in a variety of tissues and provide a stromal role in regulating progenitor cell function. Current studies focus on identifying the specific factors in the niche that can alter the MSC secretome, ultimately determining the effectiveness and timing of tissue repair. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the extent to which substrate and mechanical strain simultaneously regulate MSC quantity, gene expression, and secretome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various pathologies and lifestyle factors, such as nutritional factors and physical exercises, can alter the gene expression of proteins related to synthesis and degradation. AIM: We performed a systematic review of atrophy models, cancer models, burn models, sepsis models, cardiac insufficiency models, amino acid supplementation models, protein supplementation models, and miscellaneous models that have altered the gene expression of MTOR, MURF-1, or MAFBX in rats and mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the literature in the following databases: Medline, Scielo.org, Scielo.br, Redib, Lilacs, and the Periodicos Capes. RESULTS: We selected 56 articles for this review. DISCUSSION: Several conditions can alter the gene expression of muscle proteins under conditions that stimulate muscle degradation pathways. Therefore, treatments must normalize the expression of the degradation pathways and potentiate the synthesis pathways so the muscular tissue confers an increase in functional capacity and thus, survival in diseased patients. Therefore, the reversal of the mechanisms that promote its depletion must be achieved. CONCLUSION: Identification of the atrophic mechanisms present in pathologies and other conditions of muscular disuse in the scientific literature is fundamental for the adoption of clinical strategies to prevent protein degradation and to promote the maintenance and/or increase of muscle tissue. Such strategies include physical exercise, protein supplementation, and/or pharmacological applications, aimed toward restoring the fullness of functional capacity.

AB  - Livestock production has a major impact on the environment. Choosing a more environmentally-friendly livestock product in a diet can mitigate environmental impact. The objective of this research was to compare assessments of the environmental impact of livestock products. Twenty-five peer-reviewed studies were found that assessed the impact of production of pork, chicken, beef, milk, and eggs using life cycle analysis (LCA). Only 16 of these studies were reviewed, based on five criteria: study from an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) country, non-organic production, type of LCA methodology, allocation method used, and definition of system boundary. LCA results of these 16 studies were expressed in three ways: per kg product, per kg protein, and per kg of average daily intake of each product for an OECD country. The review yielded a consistent ranging of results for use of land and energy, and for climate change. No clear pattern was found, however, for eutrophication and acidification. Production of 1kg of beef used most land and energy, and had highest global warming potential (GWP), followed by production of 1kg of pork, chicken, eggs, and milk. Differences in environmental impact among pork, chicken, and beef can be explained mainly by 3 factors: differences in feed efficiency, differences in enteric CH4 emission between monogastric animals and ruminants, and differences in reproduction rates. The impact of production of 1kg of meat (pork, chicken, beef) was high compared with production of 1kg of milk and eggs because of the relatively high water content of milk and eggs. Production of 1kg of beef protein also had the highest impact, followed by pork protein, whereas chicken protein had the lowest impact. This result also explained why consumption of beef was responsible for the largest part of the land use and GWP in an average OECD diet. This review did not show consistent differences in environmental impact per kg protein in milk, pork, chicken and eggs. Only one study compared environmental impact of meat versus milk and eggs. Conclusions regarding impact of pork or chicken versus impact of milk or eggs require additional comparative studies and further harmonization of LCA methodology. Interpretation of current LCA results for livestock products, moreover, is hindered because results do not include environmental consequences of competition for land between humans and animals, and consequences of land-use changes. We recommend, therefore, to include these consequences in future LCAs of livestock products.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the cause/s of muscle fatigue experienced during a half-iron distance triathlon. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited 25 trained triathletes (36±7 yr; 75.1±9.8 kg) for the study. Before and just after the race, jump height and leg muscle power output were measured during a countermovement jump on a force platform to determine leg muscle fatigue. Body weight, handgrip maximal force and blood and urine samples were also obtained before and after the race. Blood myoglobin and creatine kinase concentrations were determined as markers of muscle damage. RESULTS: Jump height (from 30.3±5.0 to 23.4±6.4 cm; P<0.05) and leg power output (from 25.6±2.9 to 20.7±4.6 W · kg(-1); P<0.05) were significantly reduced after the race. However, handgrip maximal force was unaffected by the race (430±59 to 430±62 N). Mean dehydration after the race was 2.3±1.2% with high inter-individual variability in the responses. Blood myoglobin and creatine kinase concentration increased to 516±248 µg · L(-1) and 442±204 U · L(-1), respectively (P<0.05) after the race. Pre- to post-race jump change did not correlate with dehydration (r = 0.16; P>0.05) but significantly correlated with myoglobin concentration (r = 0.65; P<0.001) and creatine kinase concentration (r = 0.54; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During a half-iron distance triathlon, the capacity of leg muscles to produce force was notably diminished while arm muscle force output remained unaffected. Leg muscle fatigue was correlated with blood markers of muscle damage suggesting that muscle breakdown is one of the most relevant sources of muscle fatigue during a triathlon.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine physiologic responses to typical activities of military Italian firefighters. Heart rate (HR), metabolic equivalent units (MET), skin temperature ( T.Sk.), and galvanic skin response (GSR) were measured in 13 firefighters (age = 36.3 +/- 6.9 yr; period of military fire service = 16.8 +/- 7 yr) during the acclimation phase (5 min standing, still dressed in their protective clothing), the work phase (simulated firefighting situations), and the following 24 hours. Multivariate linear step-wise regression showed that body mass index was highly correlated with mean and minimal HR values during the acclimation phase (beta 0.59, p < 0.001; beta 1.90, p = 0.003) and with mean and maximum HR values during the work phase (beta 1.08, p = 0.05; beta 1.17, p = 0.04), increasing cardiovascular stress. Firefighting tasks were associated with high energy expenditure. The minimum and mean MET values, during the acclimation phase, were significantly correlated with age (beta 0.49, p = 0.008 and beta 0.46, p < 0.01). During the work phase, maximal MET values were also strongly correlated with weight (beta 0.51, p = 0.03). No correlations between predictor and dependent variables were found for GSR; however, the high GSR levels recorded during the work phase returned to normal values only 12 hours after completion of the work phase, indicating that high levels of psychological stress remain, even after physical recovery. The data obtained in this study demonstrate that the physical fitness and anthropometric characteristics of firefighters influence the performance of firefighting tasks. These results may be useful to set up specific training that meets the real needs of firefighters in terms of physical fitness.

AB  - Currently, a submaximal protocol is used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness in firefighters by estimating their true aerobic capacity (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max); however, this submaximal test has not been cross-validated among firefighters. Thirty firefighters (85% male, 15% female), completed the submaximal protocol and the maximal (Bruce) treadmill protocol on separate occasions. Pearson's correlation analyses between the submaximal and Bruce protocol revealed a significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.635, p = 0.005). The range of mean V[Combining Dot Above]O2max values and SDs produced from the submaximal and maximal protocols varied greatly (35.4-50.9 vs. 28.6-58.4 ml.kg.min, and SD of 3.91 vs. 7.22, respectively). The submaximal V[Combining Dot Above]O2 test underestimated the true V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in the majority of firefighters (72.4%) and overestimated the true V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in the remainder of firefighters. Participants with a higher body fat percentage were more likely (p = 0.0157) to have an overestimated true V[Combining Dot Above]O2max than those with a lower-body fat percentage. Our results indicate the current submaximal V[Combining Dot Above]O2 test used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness in firefighters is an improvement over previous protocols. However, our findings also show that the accuracy of this submaximal test for predicting the true V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in firefighters is questionable, and may not identify firefighters who possess substandard cardiorespiratory fitness, particularly in those with a higher percentage of body fat. Thus, the results of this study indicate that improvements to the current Fire Service Joint Management, Wellness & Fitness Initiative (WFI) V[Combining Dot Above]O2 assessment is still needed to accurately reflect the true V[Combining Dot Above]O2max of individual firefighters.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of an asymmetric sidepack carrying system on frontal plane joint moments of force in both lower extremities and in the L5/S1 joint during level walking. Ground reaction force data and frontal plane film records were obtained from five males performing three walking conditions: 0, 10 and 20% bodyweight loads in a sidepack supported by the left shoulder. Inverse dynamics were used to calculate the lower extremity moments during stance and a static model of the pelvis was used to calculate the L5/S1 moments during single support for each limb. Normal walking was characterized by symmetric kinetics between left and right limbs and around the L5/S1 joint. The asymmetric loads produced unbalanced lateral trunk muscle dominance between left and right limb stance phases, increased right hip and knee moments and decreased left hip and knee moments. During normal walking, the L5/S1 moment was dominant on the contralateral trunk side for both limbs. The asymmetric loads applied to the left side caused a shift in L5/S1 moment dominance to the right side during left and right single support phases.

AB  - Recommendations on backpack loading advice restricting the load to 10% of body weight and carrying the load high on the spine. The effects of increasing load (0%-5%-10%-15% of body weight) and changing the placement of the load on the spine, thoracic vs. lumbar placement, during standing and gait were analysed in 20 college-aged students by studying physiological, biomechanical and subjective data. Significant changes were: (1) increased thorax flexion; (2) reduced activity of M. erector spinae vs. increased activation of abdominals; (3) increased heart rate and Borg scores for the heaviest loads. A trend towards increased spinal flexion, reduced pelvic anteversion and rectus abdominis muscle activity was observed for the lumbar placement. The subjective scores indicate a preference for the lumbar placement. These findings suggest that carrying loads of 10% of body weight and above should be avoided, since these loads induce significant changes in electromyography, kinematics and subjective scores. Conclusions on the benefits of the thoracic placement for backpack loads could not be drawn based on the parameter set studied.

RN  - Four subjects with mild and 8 with severe ocular motor involvement as a result of progressive supranuclear palsy were recruited. Overall goal was to determine if foot kinematics were influenced by gaze shifts immediately prior to step initiation. The “severe” subjects had 50% or less downward gazing ability while the mild subjects had greater than 50% ability. Eye movement along with head pitch were collected, along with lead and log foot lift. Results showed that severe subjects had low lag foot lift relative to lead foot lift and a low lag foot trajectory. Those with mild gaze deficits had the opposite effects.

AB  - There is an enormous amount of literature on psychological stress and cardiovascular disease. This report reviews conceptual issues in defining stress and then explores the ramifications of stress in terms of the effects of acute versus long-term stressors on cardiac functioning. Examples of acute stressor studies are discussed in terms of disasters (earthquakes) and in the context of experimental stress physiology studies, which offer a more detailed perspective on underlying physiology. Studies of chronic stressors are discussed in terms of job stress, marital unhappiness, and burden of caregiving. From all of these studies there are extensive data concerning stressors' contributions to diverse pathophysiological changes including sudden death, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and wall motion abnormalities, as well as to alterations in cardiac regulation as indexed by changes in sympathetic nervous system activity and hemostasis. Although stressors trigger events, it is less clear that stress "causes" the events. There is nonetheless overwhelming evidence both for the deleterious effects of stress on the heart and for the fact that vulnerability and resilience factors play a role in amplifying or dampening those effects. Numerous approaches are available for stress management that can decrease patients' suffering and enhance their quality of life.

AB  - In the past decade researchers have developed a body of epidemiologic evidence showing increased daily cardiovascular mortality and morbidity associated with acute exposures to particulate air pollution. Associations have been found not only with cardiovascular deaths reported on death certificates but also with myocardial infarctions and ventricular fibrillation. Particulate air pollution exposure has been associated with indicators of autonomic function of the heart including increased heart rate, decreased heart rate variability, and increased cardiac arrhythmias. Several markers of increased risk for sudden cardiac death have also been associated with such exposures. These epidemiologic studies provide early guidance to possible pathways of particulate air pollution health effects, which can only be addressed fully in toxicologic and physiologic studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Wellness-Fitness Initiative submaximal treadmill exercise test (WFI-TM) is recommended by the US National Fire Protection Agency to assess aerobic capacity (VO2 max) in firefighters. However, predicting VO2 max from submaximal tests can result in errors leading to erroneous conclusions about fitness. AIMS: To investigate the level of agreement between VO2 max predicted from the WFI-TM against its direct measurement using exhaled gas analysis. METHODS: The WFI-TM was performed to volitional fatigue. Differences between estimated VO2 max (derived from the WFI-TM equation) and direct measurement (exhaled gas analysis) were compared by paired t-test and agreement was determined using Pearson Product-Moment correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Fifty-nine men performed the WFI-TM. Mean (standard deviation) values for estimated and measured VO2 max were 44.6 (3.4) and 43.6 (7.9) ml/kg/min, respectively (P < 0.01). The mean bias by which WFI-TM overestimated VO2 max was 0.9ml/kg/min with a 95% prediction interval of +/-13.1. Prediction errors for 22% of subjects were within +/-5%; 36% had errors greater than or equal to +/-15% and 7% had greater than +/-30% errors. The correlation between predicted and measured VO2 max was r = 0.55 (standard error of the estimate = 2.8ml/kg/min). CONCLUSIONS: WFI-TM predicts VO2 max with 11% error. There is a tendency to overestimate aerobic capacity in less fit individuals and to underestimate it in more fit individuals leading to a clustering of values around 42ml/kg/min, a criterion used by some fire departments to assess fitness for duty.

AB  - Peak aerobic exercise responses were determined in 8 competitive cross-country skiers during field-testing and during an incremental treadmill test (TM) to determine peak oxygen uptake (VaO2peak), heart rate, and oxygen pulse. Field testing consisted of maximal effort roller skiing using diagonal stride (DS) and double poling (DP) techniques. VaO2 was measured during roller skiing by the portable Cosmed K4b2 breath-by-breath system. The portable system was compared against a standard laboratory mixing box system, and no differences were found across the full range of VaO2. During DS, VaO2peak and oxygen pulse were not different from TM, whereas peak HR was lower. With DP, VaO2peak and oxygen pulse were less than DS or TM, whereas peak HR was less than with TM but not different from DS. These results demonstrate the validity and utility of the portable breath-by-breath system for measurement of aerobic energy demand of athletes as they carry out their normal activity.

AB  - To examine the effects of firefighting personal protective ensemble (PPE) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) on exercise performance, 12 males completed two randomly ordered, graded exercise treadmill tests (GXTPPE and GXTPT). Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) during GXTPPE was 17.3% lower than the GXTPT in regular exercise clothing (43.0 +/- 5.7 vs. 52.4 +/- 8.5 ml/kg per min, respectively). The lower VO2max during the PPE condition was significantly related (r = 0.81, p < 0.05) to attenuated peak ventilation (142.8 +/- 18.0 vs. 167.1 +/- 15.6 l/min), which was attributed to a significant reduction in tidal volume (2.6 +/- 10.4 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.4 l). Breathing frequency at peak exercise was unchanged (55 +/- 7 vs. 53 +/- 7 breaths/min). The results of this investigation demonstrate that PPE and the SCBA have a negative impact on VO2max. These factors must be considered when evaluating aerobic demands of fire suppression work and the fitness levels of firefighters.

AB  - The Department of National Defence employs a work-related test circuit comprising 10 various firefighting tasks (FF test) to assess the fitness of incumbent Canadian Forces firefighters. The main purpose of this study was to document the oxygen cost of the FF test over a wide range of performance times. These data were then used to predict the oxygen cost associated with the 8 min completion standard. Finally, we examined the influence of gender on selected physiological responses during the FF test. Thirty male and 23 female subjects practiced the test 3-5 times and then completed, in random order and on separate days, a maximal-effort trial while breathing with either a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or a portable metabolic measurement system (MMC). The breath-by-breath gas exchange data from the MMC were collapsed into a single value that represented the average oxygen cost for each participant to complete the work simulation. To calculate the average VO2 associated with the 8 min completion time, separate regression lines for test duration and average VO2 were generated for males and females. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that the regression lines for the male and female groups coincided, therefore all data were collapsed. The resulting regression equation predicted that the average VO2 associated with the 8 min standard was 34.1 (+/-4.0) mL.kg(-1).min(-1), and this value appears consistent with other research on the oxygen cost of firefighting. There was no evidence to suggest that the oxygen cost of meeting the 8 min standard was different for males or females.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of a Cosmed K4b2 portable telemetric gas analysis system. Twelve physically fit males performed a treadmill running session consisting of an easy 10 min run, a hard 3 min run and a 1 min sprint (with rest periods of 10 min separating each run), on four separate occasions. Sessions were identical with the exception of the apparatus used to measure VO2. During two (test-retest) sessions a Cosmed K4b2 portable gas analysis system was used; in another, a laboratory metabolic cart and, in one session, both systems were used to measure VO2 simultaneously. Comparison of Cosmed K4b2 and metabolic cart measurements in isolation revealed significantly (p < 0.05) increased values of VO2, VCO2, FE CO2 (except FE CO2 at 10 min) and lower values of FE O2 for each run duration by the Cosmed system. Linear regression equations to predict metabolic cart results from Cosmed values were, respectively; cart VO2 = 0.926 (Cosmed VO2-0.227 (r2 = 0.84) and cart VCO2 = 1.057 (Cosmed VCO2-0.606 (r2 = 0.92). Bland-Altman plots and comparison of the test-retest cosmed measurements revealed that the K4b2 system showed good repeatability of measurement for measures of VE, VO2 and VCO2, particularly for 10 min and 3 min tests (ICC = 0.7-0.9, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the Cosmed K4b2 portable gas analysis system recorded consistently higher VO2 and VCO2 measurements in comparison to a metabolic cart. However, satisfactory test-retest reliability of the system was demonstrated.

AB  - To explore the differential effects of harassment on cardiovascular and neuroendocrine stress reactivity and recovery, 28 men and 32 women were randomized to a harassment or no-harassment control condition (four groups in total). The harassment consisted of three scripted statements delivered during performance of a mental arithmetic stress task. The harassing statements were delivered on a fixed schedule during the task by a same-gender experimenter. Cardiovascular, salivary cortisol, and state affect measures were taken at baseline, immediately posttask, and throughout an extended recovery period. In comparison to the control condition, harassment accentuated the stress reactivity responses on all measures, physiological and self-report of subjective affect. In addition, several gender differences in response to the stressor and during the recovery period were observed. Harassed men had the largest reactivity on cortisol and diastolic blood pressure, whereas the harassed women showed a more pronounced response on heart rate and self-reported hostility. The harassed groups were the only ones to show significant cortisol responses. Within the harassed condition, comparison of effect sizes revealed that cortisol reactivity in men was twice that of women. Control groups did not exhibit significant cortisol changes. During the recovery period, harassed men exhibited attenuated return to baseline on cardiovascular indices and cortisol, whereas women, overall, tended to exhibit an overcompensation response on cardiovascular measures. These results contribute to showing a pathway that may link negative affect (i.e., hostile or angry feelings) with the development of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - In order to establish reference equations for prediction of the total distance walked during six minutes (6MWD) for healthy adults, we administered the standardized 6-min walk test to 117 healthy men and 173 healthy women, aged 40 to 80 yr. Oxygen saturation (SaO2), pulse rate, and the degree of dyspnea (Borg scale) were determined before and at the end of the walk. The median distance walked was 576 m for men and 494 m for women. The 6MWD was significantly less for men and women who were older and heavier, and for shorter men. The resulting gender-specific regression equations explained about 40% of the variance in the distance walked for healthy adults: for men, 6MWD = (7.57 x heightcm) - (5.02 x age) - (1.76 x weightkg) - 309 m, and for women, 6MWD = (2.11 x heightcm) - (2.29 x weightkg) - (5.78 x age) + 667 m. These reference equations may be used to compute the percent predicted 6MWD for individual adult patients performing the test for the first time, when using the standardized protocol.

AB  - A standard exercise protocol that allows comparisons across various ergonomic studies would be of great value for researchers investigating the physical and physiological strains of firefighting and possible interventions for reducing the demands. We compared the pattern of cardiorespiratory changes from 21 firefighters during simulated firefighting activities using a newly developed firefighting activity station (FAS) and treadmill walking both performed within an identical laboratory setting. Data on cardiorespiratory parameters and core temperature were collected continuously using a portable metabolic unit and a wireless ingestible temperature probe. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated distinct patterns of change in cardiorespiratory parameters and heart rate between conditions. The pattern consisted of alternating periods of peaks and nadirs in the FAS that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to live fire activities, whereas the same parameters increased logarithmically in the treadmill condition. Core temperature increased in a similarly for both conditions, although more rapidly in the FAS. Practitioner Summary: The firefighting activity station (FAS) yields a pattern of cardiorespiratory responses qualitatively and quantitatively similar to live fire activities, significantly different than treadmill walking. The FAS can be performed in a laboratory/clinic, providing a potentially standardised protocol for testing interventions to improve health and safety and conducting return to duty decisions.

AB  - Livestock production impacts air and water quality, ocean health, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on regional to global scales and it is the largest use of land globally. Quantifying the environmental impacts of the various livestock categories, mostly arising from feed production, is thus a grand challenge of sustainability science. Here, we quantify land, irrigation water, and reactive nitrogen (Nr) impacts due to feed production, and recast published full life cycle GHG emission estimates, for each of the major animal-based categories in the US diet. Our calculations reveal that the environmental costs per consumed calorie of dairy, poultry, pork, and eggs are mutually comparable (to within a factor of 2), but strikingly lower than the impacts of beef. Beef production requires 28, 11, 5, and 6 times more land, irrigation water, GHG, and Nr, respectively, than the average of the other livestock categories. Preliminary analysis of three staple plant foods shows two- to sixfold lower land, GHG, and Nr requirements than those of the nonbeef animal-derived calories, whereas irrigation requirements are comparable. Our analysis is based on the best data currently available, but follow-up studies are necessary to improve parameter estimates and fill remaining knowledge gaps. Data imperfections notwithstanding, the key conclusion--that beef production demands about 1 order of magnitude more resources than alternative livestock categories--is robust under existing uncertainties. The study thus elucidates the multiple environmental benefits of potential, easy-to-implement dietary changes, and highlights the uniquely high resource demands of beef.

AB  - Our previous work showed that breathing low density gases during exercise with the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) improves maximal ventilation (V(E)) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2)max). This suggests that the SCBA limits exercise by adding a resistive load to breathing. In this study we compared VO(2)max with and without the various components comprising the SCBA to determine their impact on VO(2)max. Twelve males performed 4 randomly ordered incremental exercise tests to exhaustion on a treadmill: (1) low-resistance breathing valve only (CON); (2) full SCBA (SCBA); (3) SCBA regulator only (REG); and (4) carrying the cylinder and harness assembly but breathing through a low-resistance breathing valve (PACK). Compared to CON, VO(2)max was reduced to a similar extent in the SCBA and REG trials (14.9% and 13.1%, respectively). The PACK condition also reduced VO(2)max, but to a lesser extent (4.8 +/- 5.3%). At VO(2)max, VE was decreased and expiratory mouth pressure and external breathing resistance (BR) were increased in both the SCBA and REG trials. There was a significant correlation between the change in maximal V(E)and VO(2)max with the SCBA. The results show that the SCBA reduces VO(2)max by limiting V(E) secondary to the increased BR of the SCBA regulator.

AB  - Fire fighters are often exposed to hostile environments of heat and smoke, and this includes the possibility of becoming disoriented or trapped in a structure. When this occurs, it is crucial that there is a reliable means to alert other fire ground personnel to their need for assistance.

Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) devices are used by fire fighters to alert aid using audible signal technology, and the operate by emitting an alarm signal if the lack of motion exceeds a specific time period. However, despite its widespread use throughout the fire service and on-going enhancements in recent years, certain problems still exist with audible PASS technology such as the use of multiple different PASS alarms being used in the field. This project is directly applicable to the requirements addressed by NFPA 1982, Standard on Personal Alert Safety Systems (PASS).

This project seeks to establish a scientific basis for a single PASS alarm signal for use throughout the U.S fire service, and additionally address possible technological enhancements such as receiver enhancements and addressable non-audible frequencies. The goal of this project is to improve the safety of distressed firefighters engaged in structural firefighting operations and to aid in rescue activities, by establishing a credible and scientific basis for determining the optimum PASS signal performance characteristics and to evaluate technological enhancements for this technology.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) rectal temperature (Tre), blood pressure, temperature and relative humidity changes inside clothing were measured on 18 professional firemen (mean age 29·4 ± 7·4 yr, VQ2 max 41·4 + 8·8 ml kg?1 min?1) wearing fire fighter's uniforms (SU) or aluminized, fire resistant, impermeable clothing with self contained breathing apparatus (FE). The subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer with a work load of 1·5 Wkg?1, at 39±1°C and at 70±5% relative humidity. They stopped exercising at a point of subjective fatigue and overheating which - according to their judgement-would cause them to stop working during real fire fighting. The working time until fatigue for subjects wearing FE was considerably lower than the corresponding value for SU. The HR and Tre values rose progressively throughout the exercise with no tendency to reach a plateau. In some cases the HR reached near maximal level. The Tre continued to rise even during 10 min of recovery and in many subjects exceeded 39°C. These data showed that despite spontaneous termination of exercise, the limit of tolerance was reached by most of the subjects.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among firefighters. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of excess body weight on arterial structure and function and blood pressure (BP) in relatively young, apparently healthy, firefighters. The body mass index, brachial BP, carotid BP, aortic BP, radial augmentation index, central pulse wave velocity, forearm blood flow, forearm vasodilatory capacity, carotid arterial compliance, carotid intima-media thickness, and brachial flow-mediated dilation were assessed in 110 firefighters (aged 29.7 +/- 8.0 years). The group was divided into equal tertiles according to the body mass index (<25.9, 25.9 to 29.4, and >or=29.5 kg/m(2)). Group differences in hemodynamics, anthropometrics, microvascular function, and macrovascular structure and function were tested using multivariate analysis of variance. The obese group was older, heavier, and had a larger waist circumference compared to the lean and overweight groups (p <0.05). The overweight group was also older, heavier, and had a larger waist circumference than the lean group (p <0.05). Compared to the lean group, the overweight and obese groups had a greater systolic BP (p <0.05). The obese group also had a significantly greater mean arterial BP and carotid systolic BP than the lean group (p <0.05). The obese group had greater beta stiffness and elastic modulus compared to the lean and overweight groups (p <0.05), but no group differences were found in endothelial function. In conclusion, in a population of relatively young firefighters, an increased body mass index was associated with elevated peripheral BP and arterial stiffness, with no apparent decrements in endothelial function.

AB  - Sudden cardiac events are responsible for 40-50% of line-of-duty firefighter fatalities, yet the exact cause of these events is unknown. Likely, combinations of thermal, physical, and mental factors impair cardiovascular function and trigger such events. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of firefighting activities on vascular function. Sixty-nine young (28 +/- 1 years) male firefighters underwent 3 hours of firefighting activities. Carotid, aortic, and brachial blood pressures (BP), heart rate (HR), augmentation index (AIx), wave reflection timing (TR), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), forearm blood flow (FBF), and forearm reactive hyperemia (RH) were measured before and after firefighting activities. Paired samples t-tests revealed significant (p < 0.05) increases in aortic diastolic BP, HR, AIx, PWV, RH, and FBF, and significant decreases in brachial and aortic pulse pressure and TR following firefighting activities. In conclusion, these results suggest that 3 hours of firefighting activities increase both arterial stiffness and vasodilation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Advances in surface electromyography (sEMG) techniques provide a clear indication that refinement of electrode location relative to innervation zones (IZ) is required in order to optimise the accuracy, relevance and repeatability of the sEMG signals. The aim of this study was to identify the IZ for the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscles to provide guidelines for electrode positioning for future clinical and research applications. METHODS: Eleven volunteer subjects participated in this study. Myoelectric signals were detected from the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid and the anterior scalene muscles bilaterally using a linear array of 8 electrodes during isometric cervical flexion contractions. The signals were reviewed and the IZ(s) were identified, marked on the subjects' skin and measurements were obtained relative to selected anatomical landmarks. RESULTS: The position of the IZ lay consistently around the mid-point or in the superior portion of the muscles studied. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that electrodes should be positioned over the lower portion of the muscle and not the mid-point, which has been commonly used in previous studies. Recommendations for sensor placement on these muscles should assist investigators and clinicians to ensure improved validity in future sEMG applications.

AB  - In this study we examined the repeatability and reliability of the surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal mean frequency (MNF), average rectified value (ARV) and conduction velocity (CV) measured for the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and the anterior scalene (AS) muscles in nine healthy volunteers during 15-s isometric cervical flexion contractions at 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction level over 3 non-consecutive days. Repeatability and reliability estimates were obtained for the initial values and rates of change of each sEMG variable by using both the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the normalised standard error of the mean (nSEM). Results from SCM indicated good levels of repeatability for the initial value and slope of ARV (ICC>65%). For the AS, high levels of repeatability were identified for the initial value of MNF (ICC>70%) and the slope of ARV (ICC>75%). Values of nSEM in the range 2.8-7.2% were obtained for the initial values of MNF and CV for both SCM and AS, indicating clinically acceptable measurement precision. The low value obtained for the nSEM of the initial value of MNF for the AS, in combination with the high ICC, indicates that of all of the variables examined, this variable could offer the best normative index to distinguish between subjects with and without neck pain, and represents the sEMG variable of choice for future evaluation purposes.

AB  - The object of this study was to model the relationship between neck electromyography (EMG) and three-dimensional (3-D) head kinematics during gaze behavior. In two monkeys, we recorded 3-D gaze, head orientation, and bilateral EMG activity in the sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, complexus, biventer cervicis, rectus capitis posterior major, and occipital capitis inferior muscles. Head-unrestrained animals fixated and made gaze saccades between targets within a 60° × 60° grid. We performed a stepwise regression in which polynomial model terms were retained/rejected based on their tendency to increase/decrease a cross-validation-based measure of model generalizability. This revealed several results that could not have been predicted from knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. During head holding, EMG activity in most muscles was related to horizontal head orientation, whereas fewer muscles correlated to vertical head orientation and none to small random variations in head torsion. A fourth-order polynomial model, with horizontal head orientation as the only independent variable, generalized nearly as well as higher order models. For head movements, we added time-varying linear and nonlinear perturbations in velocity and acceleration to the previously derived static (head holding) models. The static models still explained most of the EMG variance, but the additional motion terms, which included horizontal, vertical, and torsional contributions, significantly improved the results. Several coordinate systems were used for both static and dynamic analyses, with Fick coordinates showing a marginal (nonsignificant) advantage. Thus, during gaze fixations, recruitment within the neck muscles from which we recorded contributed primarily to position-dependent horizontal orientation terms in our data set, with more complex multidimensional contributions emerging during the head movements that accompany gaze shifts. These are crucial components of the late neuromuscular transformations in a complete model of 3-D head-neck system and should help constrain the study of premotor signals for head control during gaze behaviors.%U http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/107/2/573.full.pdf

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is the proposed gold-standard for the assessment of aortic elastic properties. The aim of this study was to compare aortic PWV determined by a recently developed oscillometric device with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). METHODS: PWV was assessed in 40 volunteers with two different methods. The oscillometric method (PWVOSC) is based on a transfer function from the brachial pressure waves determined by oscillometric blood pressure measurements with a common cuff (Mobil-O-Graph, I.E.M. Stolberg, Germany). CMR was used to determine aortic PWVCMR with the use of the transit time method based on phase-contrast imaging at the level of the ascending and abdominal aorta on a clinical 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). RESULTS: The median age of the study population was 34 years (IQR: 24-55 years, 11 females). A very strong correlation was found between PWVOSC and PWVCMR (r = 0.859, p < 0.001). Mean PWVOSC was 6.7 ± 1.8 m/s and mean PWVCMR was 6.1 ± 1.8 m/s (p < 0.001). Analysis of agreement between the two measurements using Bland-Altman method showed a bias of 0.57 m/s (upper and lower limit of agreement: 2.49 m/s and -1.34 m/s). The corresponding coefficient of variation between both measurements was 15%. CONCLUSION: Aortic pulse wave velocity assessed by transformation of the brachial pressure waveform showed an acceptable agreement with the CMR-derived transit time method.

AB  - ABSTRACTFirefighters' skin may be exposed to chemicals via permeation/penetration of combustion byproducts through or around personal protective equipment (PPE) or from the cross-transfer of contaminants on PPE to the skin. Additionally, volatile contaminants can evaporate from PPE following a response and be inhaled by firefighters. Using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as respective markers for non-volatile and volatile substances, we investigated the contamination of firefighters' turnout gear and skin following controlled residential fire responses. Participants were grouped into three crews of twelve firefighters. Each crew was deployed to a fire scenario (one per day, four total) and then paired up to complete six fireground job assignments. Wipe sampling of the exterior of the turnout gear was conducted pre- and post-fire. Wipe samples were also collected from a subset of the gear after field decontamination. VOCs off-gassing from gear were also measured pre-fire, post-fire, and post-decon. Wipe sampling of the firefighters' hands and neck was conducted pre- and post-fire. Additional wipes were collected after cleaning neck skin. PAH levels on turnout gear increased after each response and were greatest for gear worn by firefighters assigned to fire attack and to search and rescue activities. Field decontamination using dish soap, water, and scrubbing was able to reduce PAH contamination on turnout jackets by a median of 85%. Off-gassing VOC levels increased post-fire and then decreased 17?36 min later regardless of whether field decontamination was performed. Median post-fire PAH levels on the neck were near or below the limit of detection (< 24 micrograms per square meter [µg/m2]) for all positions. For firefighters assigned to attack, search, and outside ventilation, the 75th percentile values on the neck were 152, 71.7, and 39.3 µg/m2, respectively. Firefighters assigned to attack and search had higher post-fire median hand contamination (135 and 226 µg/m2, respectively) than other positions (< 10.5 µg/m2). Cleansing wipes were able to reduce PAH contamination on neck skin by a median of 54%.

AB  - Turnout gear provides protection against dermal exposure to contaminants during firefighting; however, the level of protection is unknown. We explored the dermal contribution to the systemic dose of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters during suppression and overhaul of controlled structure burns. The study was organized into two rounds, three controlled burns per round, and five firefighters per burn. The firefighters wore new or laundered turnout gear tested before each burn to ensure lack of PAH contamination. To ensure that any increase in systemic PAH levels after the burn was the result of dermal rather than inhalation exposure, the firefighters did not remove their self-contained breathing apparatus until overhaul was completed and they were >30 m upwind from the burn structure. Specimens were collected before and at intervals after the burn for biomarker analysis. Urine was analyzed for phenanthrene equivalents using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a benzene metabolite (s-phenylmercapturic acid) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; both were adjusted by creatinine. Exhaled breath collected on thermal desorption tubes was analyzed for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We collected personal air samples during the burn and skin wipe samples (corn oil medium) on several body sites before and after the burn. The air and wipe samples were analyzed for PAHs using a liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. We explored possible changes in external exposures or biomarkers over time and the relationships between these variables using non-parametric sign tests and Spearman tests, respectively. We found significantly elevated (P < 0.05) post-exposure breath concentrations of benzene compared with pre-exposure concentrations for both rounds. We also found significantly elevated post-exposure levels of PAHs on the neck compared with pre-exposure levels for round 1. We found statistically significant positive correlations between external exposures (i.e. personal air concentrations of PAHs) and biomarkers (i.e. change in urinary PAH metabolite levels in round 1 and change in breath concentrations of benzene in round 2). The results suggest that firefighters wearing full protective ensembles absorbed combustion products into their bodies. The PAHs most likely entered firefighters' bodies through their skin, with the neck being the primary site of exposure and absorption due to the lower level of dermal protection afforded by hoods. Aromatic hydrocarbons could have been absorbed dermally during firefighting or inhaled during the doffing of gear that was off-gassing contaminants.

AB  - Despite the frequent occurrence of vehicle fires, very few studies investigating firefighters' potential inhalation exposures during vehicle fire suppression have been conducted. In this paper, we present an assessment of firefighters' health risk from vehicle fire suppression that accounts for the mixture of gases and vapors likely to be found in these fires. Summa canisters were used to collect emissions from the engine and cabin fires of a single vehicle and were analyzed for 75 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Firefighters' breathing zone concentrations (BZCs) of aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, isocyanates, and carbon monoxide were measured during the suppression of three vehicle fires. The Summa canister and BZC data were used to develop a simple model for predicting BZCs for the compounds that were not measured in the firefighters' breathing zones. Hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated by dividing the predicted and measured BZCs by the most conservative short-term exposure limits (STELs) or ceiling limits. Hazard indices (HIs) were determined by adding HQs for compounds grouped by the target organ for acute health effects. Any HIs above unity represented unacceptable risks. According to this mixture analysis, the estimated 95th percentile of the exposure distribution for the study population represents ≥9.2 times the acceptable level of risk to the respiratory tract and eyes. Furthermore, chemicals known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens contributed to >45% of these HIs. While STELs are not usually based on carcinogenicity, maintaining exposures below STELs may protect individuals from the biological stress that could result from short-term exposures to carcinogens over time. Although vehicle fires are suppressed quickly (<10 min), this assessment suggests that firefighters have the potential to be overexposed to acute toxins during vehicle fire suppression and should therefore wear self-contained breathing apparatus at all times during vehicle fire response.

AB  - In this study, we characterize the area and personal air concentrations of combustion byproducts produced during controlled residential fires with furnishings common in 21(st) century single family structures. Area air measurements were collected from the structure during active fire and overhaul (post suppression) and on the fireground where personnel were operating without any respiratory protection. Personal air measurements were collected from firefighters assigned to fire attack, victim search, overhaul, outside ventilation, and command/pump operator positions. Two different fire attack tactics were conducted for the fires (6 interior and 6 transitional) and exposures were compared between the tactics. For each of the 12 fires, firefighters were paired up to conduct each job assignment, except for overhaul that was conducted by 4 firefighters. Sampled compounds included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g., benzene), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and particulate (area air sampling only). Median personal air concentrations for the attack and search firefighters were generally well above applicable short-term occupational exposure limits, with the exception of HCN measured from search firefighters. Area air concentrations of all measured compounds decreased after suppression. Personal air concentrations of total PAHs and benzene measured from some overhaul firefighters exceeded exposure limits. Median personal air concentrations of HCN (16,300 ppb) exceeded the exposure limit for outside vent firefighters, with maximum levels (72,900 ppb) higher than the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level. Median air concentrations on the fireground (including particle count) were above background levels and highest when collected downwind of the structure and when ground-level smoke was the heaviest. No statistically significant differences in personal air concentrations were found between the 2 attack tactics. The results underscore the importance of wearing self-contained breathing apparatus when conducting overhaul or outside ventilation activities. Firefighters should also try to establish command upwind of the structure fire, and if this cannot be done, respiratory protection should be considered.

AB  - Firefighters' personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles will become contaminated with various compounds during firefighting. Some of these compounds will off-gas following a response, which could result in inhalation exposure. This study was conducted to determine the magnitude and composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during controlled structure burns that subsequently off-gassed from the firefighters' PPE, and were systemically absorbed and exhaled in firefighters' breath. Three crews of five firefighters performed entry, suppression, and overhaul during a controlled burn. We used evacuated canisters to sample air inside the burn structure during active fire and overhaul. After each burn, we placed PPE from two firefighters inside clean enclosures and sampled the air using evacuated canisters over 15 min. Firefighters' exhaled breath was collected ∼1 hr before and 4-14 min after each burn. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, the evacuated canister samples were analyzed for 64 VOCs and the exhaled breath samples were analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and styrene (BTEXS). Fourteen of the same VOCs were detected off-gassing from PPE in 50% or more of the samples. Compared to background levels, we measured >5 fold increases in mean off-gas concentrations of styrene, benzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, acetone, and cyclohexane. Several of the compounds detected off-gassing from PPE were also measured at concentrations above background during active fire and overhaul, including benzene, propene, and styrene. The overhaul and off-gas air concentrations were well below applicable short-term occupational exposure limits. Compared to pre-burn levels, we measured >2 fold increases in mean breath concentrations of benzene, toluene, and styrene after the burns. Air concentrations of BTEXS measured off-gassing from firefighters' used PPE and in firefighters' post-burn exhaled breath were significantly correlated. The firefighters may have absorbed BTEXS through both the dermal route (during firefighting) and inhalation route (from off-gassing PPE after firefighting). Firefighters should be made aware of the potential for inhalation exposure when doffing and traveling in confined vehicles with contaminated PPE and take measures to minimize this exposure pathway.

AB  - Introduction Structure fires that involve modern furnishings may emit brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), as well as brominated and chlorinated dioxins and furans, into the environment. Objectives The goal of this study was to quantify the airborne and personal protective equipment (PPE) contamination levels of these compounds during controlled residential fires in the U.S., and to evaluate gross-decontamination measures. Methods Bulk-sampling was done to confirm the presence of flame retardants (FRs) in the furnishings used in 12 controlled residential structure fires. Area air samples were collected during the fires and PPE wipe samples were collected from the firefighters’ turnout jackets and gloves after firefighting. For each fire, half of the jackets were decontaminated and the other half were not. Results Of the BFRs and OPFRs measured in air during the fire period, decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) were the most abundant, with medians of 15.6 and 408 µg/m3, respectively, and were also detected during overhaul. These and several other BFRs and OPFRs were measured on PPE. Some gloves had contaminant levels exceeding 100 ng/cm2 and were generally more contaminated than jackets. Air and surface levels of the brominated furans appeared to be higher than the chlorinated dioxins and furans. Routine gross decontamination appeared to reduce many of the BFR contaminants, but results for the OPFRs were mixed. Conclusions Structure fires are likely to result in a variety of FRs, dioxins, and furans into the environment, leading to PPE contamination for those working on the fireground. Firefighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus during all phases of the response and launder or decontaminate their PPE (including gloves) after fire events.

AB  - Fire training may expose firefighters and instructors to hazardous airborne chemicals that vary by the training fuel. We conducted area and personal air sampling during three instructional scenarios per day involving the burning of two types (designated as alpha and bravo) of oriented strand board (OSB), pallet and straw, or the use of simulated smoke, over a period of 5 days. Twenty-four firefighters and ten instructors participated. Firefighters participated in each scenario once (separated by about 48 hr) and instructors supervised three training exercise per scenarios (completed in 1 day). Personal air samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen cyanide during live-fire scenarios (excluding simulated smoke). Area air samples were analyzed for acid gases, aldehydes, isocyanates, and VOCs for all scenarios. For the live-fire scenarios, median personal air concentrations of benzene and PAHs exceeded applicable short-term exposure limits and were higher among firefighters than instructors. When comparing results by type of fuel, personal air concentrations of benzene and PAHs were higher for bravo OSB compared to other fuels. Median area air concentrations of aldehydes and isocyanates were also highest during the bravo OSB scenario, while pallet and straw produced the highest median concentrations of certain VOCs and acid gases. These results suggest usage of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) by both instructors and firefighters is essential during training fires to reduce potential inhalation exposure. Efforts should be taken to clean skin and clothing as soon as possible after live-fire training to limit dermal absorption as well.

AB  - Introduction Firefighters are exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during structural fire responses and training fires, several of which (e.g., benzene, acrolein, styrene) are known or probable carcinogens. Exposure studies have found that firefighters can absorb chemicals like benzene even when self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are worn, suggesting that dermal absorption contributes to potentially harmful exposures. However, few studies have characterized VOC metabolites in urine from firefighters. Objectives We quantified VOC metabolites in firefighters’ urine following live firefighting activity across two field studies. Methods In two separate controlled field studies, spot urine was collected before and 3 h after firefighters and firefighter students responded to simulated residential and training fires. Urine was also collected from instructors from the training fire study before the first and 3 h after the last training scenario for each day (instructors led three training scenarios per day). Samples were analyzed for metabolites of VOCs to which firefighters may be exposed. Results In the residential fire study, urinary metabolites of xylenes (2MHA), toluene (BzMA), and styrene (MADA) increased significantly (at 0.05 level) from pre- to post-fire. In the training fire study, MADA concentrations increased significantly from pre- to post-fire for both firefighter students and instructors. Urinary concentrations of benzene metabolites (MUCA and PhMA) increased significantly from pre- to post-fire for instructors, while metabolites of xylenes (3MHA+4MHA) and acrolein (3HPMA) increased significantly for firefighter students. The two highest MUCA concentrations measured post-shift from instructors exceeded the BEI of 500 μg/g creatinine. Conclusions Some of the metabolites that were significantly elevated post-fire are known or probable human carcinogens (benzene, styrene, acrolein); thus, exposure to these compounds should be eliminated or reduced as much as possible through the hierarchy of controls. Given stringent use of SCBA, it appears that dermal exposure contributes in part to the levels measured here.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Training fires may constitute a major portion of some firefighters' occupational exposures to smoke. However, the magnitude and composition of those exposures are not well understood and may vary by the type of training scenario and fuels. OBJECTIVES: To understand how structure fire training contributes to firefighters' and instructors' select chemical exposures, we conducted biological monitoring during exercises involving combustion of pallet and straw and oriented strand board (OSB) or the use of simulated smoke. METHODS: Urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene. RESULTS: Median concentrations of nearly all PAH metabolites in urine increased from pre-to 3-hr post-training for each scenario and were highest for OSB, followed by pallet and straw, and then simulated smoke. For instructors who supervised three trainings per day, median concentrations increased at each collection. A single day of OSB exercises led to a 30-fold increase in 1-hydroxypyrene for instructors, culminating in a median end-of-shift concentration 3.5-fold greater than median levels measured from firefighters in a previous controlled-residential fire study. Breath concentrations of benzene increased 2 to 7-fold immediately after the training exercises (with the exception of simulated smoke training). Exposures were highest for the OSB scenario and instructors accumulated PAHs with repeated daily exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Dermal absorption likely contributed to the biological levels as the respiratory route was well protected. Training academies should consider exposure risks as well as instructional objectives when selecting training exercises.

AB  - To better understand the absorption of combustion byproducts during firefighting, we performed biological monitoring (breath and urine) on firefighters who responded to controlled residential fires and examined the results by job assignment and fire attack tactic. Urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene. Median concentrations of PAH metabolites in urine increased from pre-firefighting to 3-h post firefighting for all job assignments. This change was greatest for firefighters assigned to attack and search with 2.3, 5.6, 3.9, and 1.4-fold median increases in pyrene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, and fluorene metabolites. Median exhaled breath concentrations of benzene increased 2-fold for attack and search firefighters (p < 0.01) and 1.4-fold for outside vent firefighters (p = 0.02). Compared to interior attack, transitional attack resulted in 50% less uptake of pyrene (p = 0.09), 36% less uptake phenanthrene (p = 0.052), and 20% less uptake of fluorene (p < 0.01). Dermal absorption likely contributed to firefighters' exposures in this study. Firefighters' exposures will vary by job assignment and can be reduced by employing a transitional fire attack when feasible.

AB  - This study examined standard echocardiographic measures of cardiac size and performance in response to a 3-h firefighting training exercise. Forty experienced male personnel completed a standardized 3 h live firefighting exercise. Before and after the firefighting activities, participants were weighed, height, heart rate, blood pressure and blood samples were obtained, and echocardiographic measurements were made. Firefighting produced significant decreases in left ventricular diastolic dimension, stroke volume, fractional shortening, and mitral E velocity, tachycardia, a rise in core temperature, and a reduction in calculated plasma volume. On tissue Doppler imaging, there were no changes in systolic contractile function, but a decreased lateral wall diastolic velocity was observed. These findings show that 3 h of live firefighting produced cardiac changes consistent with cardiac fatigue, coupled with a decrease in systemic arterial compliance. These data show that live firefighting produces significant cardiovascular changes and future work is needed to evaluate if these changes are related to the increase in cardiovascular risk during live firefighting.

AB  - Purpose. To define reference values for head–cervical range of motion (ROM) in healthy young adults, to assess the effect of sex, and to quantify the separate contribution of other body districts. Methods. Thirty women and 30 men performed maximal head and cervical spine flexion–extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Movements were detected using a digital optoelectronic instrument. Maximum head–cervical spine and thoracic motions were separated. Results. Flexion and extension were performed mainly in the sagittal plane. The movement was larger in women (136°) than in men (130°). During flexion, both sexes moved the head–neck and the thorax in the same direction. During extension, men moved only the head–cervical spine, while women moved the two analyzed districts in the opposite directions. Lateral bending was nearly symmetric, associated with head–cervical rotation and extension, and larger in women (91°) than in men (77°). Adjunctive thoracic motion was limited in the sagittal and frontal planes, but larger in the horizontal plane (opposite motions of about 20°). Head–neck rotation was symmetric, and associated with concomitant movements in both the sagittal and frontal planes. It was larger in women (162°) than in men (155°), and performed with limited adjunctive thoracic motions. Conclusions. The present values can be used as a first group of normative data for head–cervical ROM in young men and women. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The exposure of fire-fighting trainers to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was assessed by personal air sampling. Uptake of PAH was determined by biological monitoring, measuring a metabolite of pyrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, in urine. Eight-hour time-weighted average concentrations benzo(a)pyrene of 0.029 microgram/m3 (instructor), 0.045 microgram/m3 (safety officer), and 0.16 microgram/m3 (fire assistant) were found. Both tobacco smoking and exposure to smoke from fire appeared to be significant sources of increased 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in fire-fighting trainers. There was evidence of exposure and uptake of PAH among fire-fighting instructors despite the short time of effective exposure and the routine use of protective respirators and protective clothing. Though the uptake of PAH was much lower than found in coke-oven workers, who are known to have an increased relative risk of cancer, a long-term health risk for fire-fighting trainers cannot be excluded. Biological monitoring with urinary 1-hydroxypyrene may be useful in tracing highly exposed persons and in monitoring the effectiveness of control measures.

AB  - PURPOSE: It remains unclear whether exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) increases heat strain during subsequent exercise heat stress, which in turn may increase the risk of exertional heat illness. We examined heat strain during exercise heat stress 30 min after EIMD to coincide with increases in circulating pyrogens (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and 24 h after EIMD to coincide with the delayed muscle inflammatory response when a higher rate of metabolic energy expenditure (M˙) and thus decreased economy might also increase heat strain. METHODS: Thirteen non-heat-acclimated males (mean ± SD, age = 20 ± 2 yr) performed exercise heat stress tests (running for 40 min at 65% V˙O2max in 33°C, 50% humidity) 30 min (HS1) and 24 h (HS2) after treatment, involving running for 60 min at 65% V˙O2max on either -10% gradient (EIMD) or +1% gradient (CON) in a crossover design. Rectal (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperature, local sweating rate, and M˙ were measured throughout HS tests. RESULTS: Compared with CON, EIMD evoked higher circulating IL-6 pre-HS1 (P < 0.01) and greater plasma creatine kinase and muscle soreness pre-HS2 (P < 0.01). The ΔTre was greater after EIMD than CON during HS1 (0.35°C, 95% confidence interval = 0.11°C-0.58°C, P < 0.01) and HS2 (0.17°C, 95% confidence interval = 0.07°C-0.28°C, P < 0.01). M˙ was higher on EIMD throughout HS1 and HS2 (P < 0.001). Thermoeffector responses (Tsk, sweating rate) were not altered by EIMD. Thermal sensation and RPE were higher on EIMD after 25 min during HS1 (P < 0.05). The final Tre during HS1 correlated with the pre-HS1 circulating IL-6 concentration (r = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Heat strain was increased during endurance exercise in the heat conducted 30 min after and, to a much lesser extent, 24 h after muscle-damaging exercise. These data indicate that EIMD is a likely risk factor for exertional heat illness particularly during exercise heat stress when behavioral thermoregulation cues are ignored.

AB  - CONTEXT: With regard to sideline concussion testing, the effect of fatigue associated with different types of exercise on postural control is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of fatigue on postural control in healthy college-aged athletes performing anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocols and to establish an immediate recovery time course from each exercise protocol for postural control measures to return to baseline status. DESIGN: Counterbalanced, repeated measures. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six collegiate athletes (18 males, 18 females; age = 19.00 +/- 1.01 years, height = 172.44 +/- 10.47 cm, mass = 69.72 +/- 12.84 kg). INTERVENTION(S): Participants completed 2 counterbalanced sessions within 7 days. Each session consisted of 1 exercise protocol followed by postexercise measures of postural control taken at 3-, 8-, 13-, and 18-minute time intervals. Baseline measures were established during the first session, before the specified exertion protocol was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) results, sway velocity, and elliptical sway area. RESULTS: We found a decrease in postural control after each exercise protocol for all dependent measures. An interaction was noted between exercise protocol and time for total BESS score (P = .002). For both exercise protocols, all measures of postural control returned to baseline within 13 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Postural control was negatively affected after anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocols as measured by total BESS score, elliptical sway area, and sway velocity. The effect of exertion lasted up to 13 minutes after each exercise was completed. Certified athletic trainers and clinicians should be aware of these effects and their recovery time course when determining an appropriate time to administer sideline assessments of postural control after a suspected mild traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Firefighting activities appear to increase the risk of acute and chronic lung disease, including malignancy. While self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) mitigate exposures to inhalable asphyxiates and carcinogens, firefighters frequently remove SCBA during overhaul when the firegrounds appear clear of visible smoke. Using a mouse model of overhaul without airway protection, the impact of fireground environment exposure on lung gene expression was assessed to identify transcripts potentially critical to firefighter-related chronic pulmonary illnesses. Lung tissue was collected 2 hrs post-overhaul and evaluated via whole genome transcriptomics by RNA-seq. Although gas metering showed that the fireground overhaul levels of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen cyanine (HCN), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and oxygen (O2) were within NIOSH ceiling recommendations, 3852 lung genes were differentially expressed when mice exposed to overhaul were compared to mice on the fireground but outside the overhaul environment. Importantly, overhaul exposure was associated with an up/down-regulation of 86 genes with a fold change of 1.5 or greater (p<0.5) including the immunomodulatory-linked genes S100a8 and Tnfsf9 (downregulation) and the cancer-linked genes, Capn11 and Rorc (upregulation). Taken together these findings indicate that, without respiratory protection, exposure to the fireground overhaul environment is associated with transcriptional changes impacting proteins potentially related to inflammation-associated lung disease and cancer.

AB  - Fire suppression and rescue is a physiologically demanding occupation due to extreme external heat as well as the physical and thermal burden of the protective garments. These conditions challenge body temperature homeostasis and results in heat stress. Accurate field assessment of core temperature is complex and unreliable. The present investigation developed a perceptually based hyperthermia metric to measure physiologic exertional heat strain during treadmill exercise. Sixty-five (28.9 +/- 6.8 years) female (n = 11) and male (n = 54) firefighters and non-firefighting volunteers participated in four related exertional heat stress investigations performing treadmill exercise in a heated room while wearing thermal protective clothing. Body core temperature, perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were assessed at baseline, 20-mins exercise, and at termination. Perceived exertion increased from baseline (0.24 +/- 0.42) to termination (7.43 +/- 1.86). Thermal sensation increased from baseline (1.78 +/- 0.77) to termination (4.50 +/- 0.68). Perceived exertion and thermal sensation were measured concurrently with body core temperature to develop a two-dimensional graphical representation of three exertional heat strain zones representative of a range of mean body core temperature responses such that low risk (green) incorporated 36.0-37.4 degrees C, moderate risk (yellow) incorporated 37.5-37.9 degrees C, and high risk (red) incorporated 38.0 to greater than 40.5 degrees C. The perceptual hyperthermia index (PHI) may provide a quick and easy momentary assessment of the level of risk for exertional heat stress for firefighters engaged in fire suppression that may be beneficial in high-risk environments that threaten the lives of firefighters.

AB  - Firefighters frequently have to work in direct solar radiant heat. To reduce firefighter heat stress, the influence of turnout garment properties on heat gain from solar radiation must be understood. This research studied the effects of color, texture, washing, and contamination of outer shell fabrics on heat loss through firefighter turnout fabric materials in simulated solar exposures. It showed that solar radiation could be a major factor in heat loss through turnout suits. Solar radiation equivalent to a sunny day completely reversed heat exchange through the turnout fabric systems, converting a heat loss of about 240 W/m2 to a heat gain exceeding 100 W/m2. Solar radiation caused turnout fabric systems to dry out and this decreased the performance of turnout systems that incorporated bi-component moisture barriers. Most significantly, the color of the outer shell had a major influence on lowering turnout heat loss in solar exposures. Composites with a black-dyed outer shell absorbed more solar energy than composites with lighter colored shell materials. Soot and fire-ground contaminants present on turnout outer shell fabrics also reduced heat loss under solar exposure. The findings of this study answered long-standing questions about the importance of turnout fabric color on heat exchange with the environment. The results provide additional motivation for efficient turnout cleaning practices, not only to reduce potentially toxic exposure to smoke contaminants, but to reduce turnout-gear-related heat strain on firefighters.

AB  - Acquisition of drug resistance is an enormous obstacle for osteosarcoma (OS) treatment. Copious microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to participate in chemoresistance. However, the role and molecular basis of miR-375 in cisplatin (Cis/DDP) sensitivity in OS remain unclear. Expression of miR-375 and autophagy-related 2B (ATG2B) in OS was examined by reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot assay. The value of 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) for DDP was determined by Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay. Cell autophagy was measured with cell proliferation, apoptotic rate, acridine orange-positive cells, and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio determined by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and western blot assay. The candidate target of miR-375 was predicted using TargetScan and was further validated by luciferase reporter and western blot analyses. Mice xenograft model was established to further investigate the tumorigenesis of U2OS/DDP in vivo. In the study, miR-375 was downregulated in DDP-resistant OS tissues and cell lines U2OS and MG63. Elevated miR-375 or reduced ATG2B decreased cell proliferation, acridine orange-positive cells and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and increased apoptosis rate in U2OS/DDP and MG63/DDP cells, as accompanied with lower IC50 value for DDP. ATG2B was identified to be a target of miR-375. Re-expression of ATG2B abolished miR-375-mediated effects on cell autophagy. Moreover, the reintroduction of miR-375 slowed down tumor growth of U2OD/DDP cells in vivo. In conclusion, miR-375 suppressed cells autophagy and tumor growth in DDP-resistant U2OS/DDP and MG63/DDP cells by targeting ATG2B, providing a potential target for the treatment of DDP-resistant OS.

AB  - Space is the final frontier for understanding how extreme environments affect human physiology. Following twin astronauts, one of which spent a year-long mission on the International Space Station, Garrett-Bakelman et al. examined molecular and physiological traits that may be affected by time in space (see the Perspective by Löbrich and Jeggo). Sequencing the components of whole blood revealed that the length of telomeres, which is important to maintain in dividing cells and may be related to human aging, changed substantially during space flight and again upon return to Earth. Coupled with changes in DNA methylation in immune cells and cardiovascular and cognitive effects, this study provides a basis to assess the hazards of long-term space habitation.Science, this issue p. eaau8650; see also p. 127INTRODUCTIONTo date, 559 humans have been flown into space, but long-duration (&amp;gt;300 days) missions are rare (n = 8 total). Long-duration missions that will take humans to Mars and beyond are planned by public and private entities for the 2020s and 2030s; therefore, comprehensive studies are needed now to assess the impact of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, brain, and overall physiology. The space environment is made harsh and challenging by multiple factors, including confinement, isolation, and exposure to environmental stressors such as microgravity, radiation, and noise. The selection of one of a pair of monozygotic (identical) twin astronauts for NASA’s first 1-year mission enabled us to compare the impact of the spaceflight environment on one twin to the simultaneous impact of the Earth environment on a genetically matched subject.RATIONALEThe known impacts of the spaceflight environment on human health and performance, physiology, and cellular and molecular processes are numerous and include bone density loss, effects on cognitive performance, microbial shifts, and alterations in gene regulation. However, previous studies collected very limited data, did not integrate simultaneous effects on multiple systems and data types in the same subject, or were restricted to 6-month missions. Measurement of the same variables in an astronaut on a year-long mission and in his Earth-bound twin indicated the biological measures that might be used to determine the effects of spaceflight. Presented here is an integrated longitudinal, multidimensional description of the effects of a 340-day mission onboard the International Space Station.RESULTSPhysiological, telomeric, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic, immune, microbiomic, cardiovascular, vision-related, and cognitive data were collected over 25 months. Some biological functions were not significantly affected by spaceflight, including the immune response (T cell receptor repertoire) to the first test of a vaccination in flight. However, significant changes in multiple data types were observed in association with the spaceflight period; the majority of these eventually returned to a preflight state within the time period of the study. These included changes in telomere length, gene regulation measured in both epigenetic and transcriptional data, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, subfoveal choroidal thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness, and serum metabolites. In addition, some factors were significantly affected by the stress of returning to Earth, including inflammation cytokines and immune response gene networks, as well as cognitive performance. For a few measures, persistent changes were observed even after 6 months on Earth, including some genes’ expression levels, increased DNA damage from chromosomal inversions, increased numbers of short telomeres, and attenuated cognitive function.CONCLUSIONGiven that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight. The persistence of the molecular changes (e.g., gene exp ession) and the extrapolation of the identified risk factors for longer missions (&amp;gt;1 year) remain estimates and should be demonstrated with these measures in future astronauts. Finally, changes described in this study highlight pathways and mechanisms that may be vulnerable to spaceflight and may require safeguards for longer space missions; thus, they serve as a guide for targeted countermeasures or monitoring during future missions.Multidimensional, longitudinal assays of the NASA Twins Study.(Left and middle) Genetically identical twin subjects (ground and flight) were characterized across 10 generalized biomedical modalities before (preflight), during (inflight), and after flight (postflight) for a total of 25 months (circles indicate time points at which data were collected). (Right) Data were integrated to guide biomedical metrics across various “-omes” for future missions (concentric circles indicate, from inner to outer, cytokines, proteome, transcriptome, and methylome).To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress–related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight.

AB  - In elite sport, where opponents are evenly matched, small factors can determine the outcome of sporting contests. Not all athletes know the value of making wise nutrition choices, but anything that might give a competitive edge, including dietary supplements, can seem attractive. Between 40% and 100% of athletes typically use supplements, depending on the type of sport, level of competition, and the definition of supplements. However, unless the athlete has a nutrient deficiency, supplementation may not improve performance and may have a detrimental effect on both performance and health. Dietary supplements are classified as a subcategory of food, so manufacturers are not required to provide evidence of product safety and efficacy, nor obtain approval from regulatory bodies before marketing supplements. This creates the potential for health risks, and serious adverse effects have been reported from the use of some dietary supplements. Athletes who compete in sports under an anti-doping code must also realize that supplement use exposes them to a risk of ingesting banned substances or precursors of prohibited substances. Government systems of regulations do not include specific laboratory testing for banned substances according to the WADA list, so a separate regulatory framework to evaluate supplements for their risk of provoking a failed doping test is needed. In the high-performance culture typical of elite sport, athletes may use supplements regardless of possible risks. A discussion around medical, physiological, cultural, and ethical questions may be warranted to ensure that the athlete has the information needed to make an informed choice.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if PKB signaling is decreased and contractile protein degradation is increased in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles from middle-aged (MA) and aged (AG) mice. We also examined the effect of age on atrogene expression in quadriceps muscle. PKB activity, as assessed by Thr(308) and Ser(473) phosphorylation, was significantly higher in EDL and SOL muscles from AG than MA mice. The age-related increase in PKB activity appears to be due to an increase in expression of the kinase, as PKB-α and PKB-β levels were significantly higher in EDL and SOL muscles from AG than MA mice. The phosphorylation of forkhead box 3a (FOXO3a) on Thr(32), a PKB target, was significantly higher in EDL muscles from AG than MA mice. The rate of contractile protein degradation was similar in EDL and SOL muscles from AG and MA mice. Atrogin-1 and muscle-specific RING finger protein 1 (MuRF-1) mRNA levels did not change in muscles from AG compared with MA mice, indicating that ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis does not contribute to sarcopenia. A significant decrease in Bcl-2 and 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) and GABA receptor-associated protein 1 (Gabarap1) mRNA was observed in muscles from AG compared with MA mice, which may contribute to age-related contractile dysfunction. In conclusion, the mechanisms responsible for sarcopenia are distinct from experimental models of atrophy and do not involve atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 or enhanced proteolysis. Finally, a decline in autophagy-related gene expression may provide a novel mechanism for impaired contractile function and muscle metabolism with advancing age.

AB  - Beef makes a substantial contribution to food security, providing protein, energy and also essential micro-nutrients to human populations. Rumination allows cattle - and other ruminant species - to digest fibrous feeds that cannot be directly consumed by humans and thus to make a net positive contribution to food balances. This contribution is of particular importance in marginal areas, where agro-ecological conditions and weak infrastructures do not offer much alternative. It is also valuable where cattle convert crop residues and by-products into edible products and where they contribute to soil fertility through their impact on nutrients and organic matter cycles. At the same time, environmental sustainability issues are acute. They chiefly relate to the low efficiency of beef cattle in converting natural resources into edible products. Water use, land use, biomass appropriation and greenhouse gas emissions are for example typically higher per unit of edible product in beef systems than in any other livestock systems, even when corrected for nutritional quality. This particularly causes environmental pressure when production systems are specialized towards the delivery of edible products, in large volumes. The paper discusses environmental challenges at global level, recognizing the large diversity of systems. Beef production is faced with a range of additional sustainability challenges, such as changing consumer perceptions, resilience to climate change, animal health and inequities in access to land and water resources. Entry-points for environmental sustainability improvement are discussed within this broader development context.

AB  - Gerstner, GR, Giuliani, HK, Mota, JA, and Ryan, ED. Influence of muscle quality on the differences in strength from slow to fast velocities in career firefighters. J Strength Cond Res 32(10): 2982-2986, 2018-The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between ultrasound-derived muscle quality and the %decrease in peak torque (PT) from slow to fast velocities in career firefighters. Thirty-nine male career firefighters (mean ± SD: age = 36.90 ± 6.87 years; stature = 180.93 ± 6.98 cm; mass = 109.30 ± 20.57 kg; and body mass index [BMI] = 33.24 ± 4.95 kg·m) performed 3 maximal concentric isokinetic contractions at a slow (1.05 rad·s) and fast (4.19 rad·s) velocity in random order. The velocity-related decrease in PT was calculated as the %decrease from 1.05 to 4.19 rad·s. Ultrasonography was used to determine subcutaneous fat corrected echo intensity (EI) to represent muscle quality before strength testing. The results indicated that there was a significant relationship between EI and %decrease in PT while adjusting for age (rpartial = 0.331, p = 0.042), and age and BMI (rpartial = 0.325, p = 0.050). These findings suggest that velocity-impaired isokinetic strength may be influenced by alterations in skeletal muscle tissue composition. Future studies are needed to determine whether the %decrease in PT is related to performance during critical firefighter tasks.

AB  - As the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) rises, public health-related interventions aimed at prevention of heart disease have gained medical attention. Clinical research reports that exercise is a protective risk factor associated with CVD and that clinicians need to provide exercise recommendations to patients. Nevertheless, physical inactivity remains a public health problem. In certain populations, like firefighters (FF), increased risk of CVD is especially concerning. The workload FF face is extreme, 50% of line-of-duty deaths (LODD) in FF are cardiac-related, and research on the volunteer FF population is scarce. Government regulations do not require volunteer FF companies to have fitness testing or programming, so exercise intervention studies are necessary to improve the burden of CVD risk in this population. Therefore, this study examined the effects of a 4-week exercise circuit training (CT) intervention on vascular health and fitness in volunteer FF (N = 27) from the Philadelphia PA area compared to a control group of Non-FF (N = 25). Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), augmentation index, and pulse pressure (PP), brachial and central blood pressure (BP) and fitness were measured pre- and post- intervention. Overall, volunteer FF had more significant improvements (p < 0.05) in vascular health measures (FMD, IMT, and PP). In both groups, we also found that brachial and central BP decreased with exercise. We show that a 4 week CT program can improve vascular structure and function in the volunteer FF population, suggesting that clinicians may be able to reduce or prevent cardiac LODD by exercise.

AB  - A robust tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) based system is developed and deployed to make real-time water-vapor concentration measurements in quasi-controlled live-fire experiments conducted in firefighter training props. This system targets the 1392.5 nm (7181.15 cm−1) water-vapor absorption line while employing a multi-tier detection sensitivity scheme that allows for measurements at multiple locations in fire environment through varying smoke obscuration levels. Temperature-corrected absorbance values are compared to HITRAN simulations to quantify water-vapor concentration. Upon validation in laboratory setting, the impact of firefighter hose stream application on water-vapor concentration is studied. Comparative effects of training structures (metal, concrete and drywall-lined) and fuel-loads (pallet/straw, lightweight furnishings and pallet/straw/oriented-strand-board (OSB)) on water-vapor concentration are characterized. Despite small increase in water-vapor concentration due to suppression, the post-suppression concentrations are found to be comparable or lower than the corresponding maximum pre-suppression concentrations in all scenarios except the metal structure. Irrespective of the structure, highest temperature and water-vapor concentrations are measured with pallet/straw/OSB fuel-load. Under identical fuel-loads, the drywall structure scenarios generate highest water-vapor concentration. Peak water-vapor concentrations are measured post-suppression in typical training structures (near-floor and crawling levels), but prior to suppression in the structure/fuel package combination that simulated a typical residential fire scenario.

AB  - Time-resolved concentrations of oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) produced by controlled propane gas burners are measured at three locations in a residential structure equipped with a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Experiments are conducted to assess the effects of HVAC operating status (off vs. on) and the impact of bedroom door position (open vs. closed) on species concentrations. Change in concentration up to the flame extinction point, the rate of change, and the transport time for the measured species at each location is compared. The CO2–O2 concentration ratio derived from these experiments correlates strongly with the stoichiometric combustion ratio. The CO2–H2O and O2–H2O ratios have a relatively strong correlation though with slightly higher variability. Both the HVAC status and bedroom door position have statistically significant influence on the total change in concentration for all the measured species. However, HVAC status only has a statistically significant effect on the rate of change of H2O but not CO2 and O2 concentrations. For all three species in both bedrooms, the concentrations typically begin to change later in experiments with HVAC off than experiments with HVAC on.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate mortality and cancer incidence of paid male Australian firefighters and of subgroups of firefighters by era of first employment, duration of employment and number and type of incidents attended. METHODS: Participating fire agencies supplied records of individual firefighters including their job histories and incidents attended. The cohort was linked to the Australian National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. SMRs and SIRs were calculated. Firefighters were grouped into tertiles by duration of employment and by number of incidents attended and relative mortality ratios and relative incidence ratios calculated. Analyses were carried out separately for full-time and part-time male firefighters. RESULTS: Compared to the Australian population, there were significant increases in overall risk of cancer, for all paid firefighters SIR 1.09 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.14), in prostate cancer, full-time firefighters 1.23 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.37), part-time 1.51 (1.28 to 1.77), and melanoma full-time 1.45 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.66), part-time firefighters 1.43 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.76). Kidney cancer was associated with longer service in internal analyses for paid firefighters. Prostate cancer was associated with longer service and increased attendance at fires, particularly structural fires for full-time firefighters.The overall risk of mortality was significantly decreased and almost all major causes of death were significantly reduced for paid firefighters. CONCLUSIONS: Male paid firefighters have an increased risk of cancer. They have reduced mortality compared with the general population, which is likely to be a result of a strong healthy worker effect and likely lower smoking rates among firefighters compared with the Australian population.

AB  - To characterize the physical demands associated with on-the-job use of current firefighting equipment and the performance of essential firefighting operations, an initial task analysis of all firefighting operations was followed by an in-depth physical and physiological characterization of those tasks deemed to be physically demanding. The most commonly encountered applications of strength and endurance were lifting and carrying objects (up to 80 lbs), pulling objects (up to 135 lbs), and working with objects in front of the body (up to 125 lbs). The most demanding firefighting operations required a mean VO2 of 41.5 ml/kg.min-1 with peak lactate concentrations of 6 to 13.2 mM. Ninety percent of the demanding firefighting operations that were studied required a mean VO2 of 23 ml/kg.min-1. These aerobic energy requirements corresponded to 85 and 50% VO2max, respectively. Therefore a minimum VO2max standard for firefighter applicants of 45 ml/kg.min-1 is recommended.

Functional Movement Screen factorial validity and measurement invariance across sex among collegiate student-athletes. J Strength Cond Res 30(12): 3388-3395, 2016-The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a screening tool used to evaluate functional movement quality and subsequent musculoskeletal injury risk. Despite recent research on the factorial validity of the FMS, no confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has been conducted to examine measurement invariance across sex among student-athletes. The primary purpose of the current study was to confirm the factor structure of the FMS measurement model in a collegiate student-athlete population. It was hypothesized that the 1-factor model would demonstrate better model fit than the recently proposed 2-factor model. The secondary purpose of the study was to examine FMS measurement invariance across sex using the previously identified measurement model. It was hypothesized that FMS measurement invariance would hold across sex. Male (n = 88) and female (n = 88) collegiate student-athletes completed FMS screening during the off-season. Factorial validity was examined using CFA procedures, and model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Measurement invariance was examined by comparison of fit indices between hierarchically constrained models. Results revealed support for both the 1- and the 2-factor models; however, the 2-factor model failed to fit the data significantly better than the 1-factor model. Results also indicated that measurement invariance did not hold across sex, indicating that the FMS sum score construct is not measured equivalently in male and female populations. Collectively, results provide evidence for the use of the unidimensional FMS sum score among collegiate student-athletes, yet prompt caution because it relates to the evaluation of sex differences in sum or movement pattern scores.

AB  - Exercise and physical strenuous activity have been demonstrated to increase the serum TNF-alpha and IL-6. Regular physical training is expected to attenuate such a response. This study was undertaken to understand the impact of regular exercise training on IL-6 and TNF-alpha in athletes and non-athletes. Ten athletes, who have been on regular training for the past 6 months, and 10 age- and sex-matched subjects (non-athlete group) who had no practice of regular exercise, were recruited. Both were subjected to undergo the same frequency level of strenuous exercise. Blood samples were collected; one before strenuous exercise and the other after the exercise. Plasma cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, were estimated using Sandwich ELISA method. All participants in the study were male with the athletes' age being 18.00+/-1.3years (mean+/-SD) and the non-athletes were aged 20.00+/-0.6years (mean+/-SD). Majority of the athletes and non-athletes demonstrated a rise in IL-6 and a fall in TNF-alpha levels. Further, the athletes showed a lesser magnitude of change in the cytokine levels following a longer duration of exercise than non-athletes. Athletes appear to have an attenuated cytokine response. Regular physical training has been demonstrated to attenuate the immune response to exercise in either direction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the characteristics of the 6-min walk (6MW) in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects of varied disability, and controls. To assess the correlation of 6MW to subjective measures of fatigue, health status and ambulation using the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), short form-36 Health Questionnaire physical component score and MS walking scale (MSWS). METHODS: Forty MS expanded disability status scale [(EDSS) 0-6.5] and 20 control subjects were recruited from a MS outpatient clinic. Subjects completed survey material and three 6MWs with 1-h interval rest in a single study visit. RESULTS: There was no practice effect or fatigability with repeat 6MW tests with a one-h rest period between test sessions. The 6MW had excellent intra-[intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.95] and inter-rater (ICC = 0.91) reliability. MS subjects demonstrated reduced 6MW distance and speed compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Within the MS population 6MW distance was significantly reduced with increasing disability (P = 0.05). Compared with the EDSS, the 6MW had a stronger correlation to subjective measures of ambulation and physical fatigue: MSWS (r = -0.81 versus 0.69) and MFISphy (0.66 versus 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The 6MW is a feasible, reproducible, and reliable measure in MS. MS subjects demonstrate motor fatigue in both 6MW distance and speed compared with controls. In MS subjects there is an inverse relationship between motor fatigue and disability. 6MW has a strong correlation to subjective measures of ambulation and physical fatigue.

AB  - In this paper, a prediction model is presented that estimates the evacuation time in an emergency situation for hospitals. The model is generic enough to be used in various hospital settings. This model can provide incident managers with estimates of the evacuation times of different types of patients and can offer support to the managers with their resource allocation decisions in emergency situations. The major advantage of the prediction model is that the computation time is very short and the model does not need a lengthy and costly design. The model was applied for several different evacuation scenarios and the results were compared with those of a simulation model which had already been designed for use by the hospital. The comparison shows that the prediction model can provide estimates of the evacuation time that are similar to the results found by using costly and time-consuming simulation models.

To examine the effect of initial body temperature [esophageal temperature (Tes) = 35.9 +/- 0.2, 37.4 +/- 0. 1, or 38.2 +/- 0.1 (SE) degrees C induced by 30 min of water immersion], seven cyclists (maximal O2 uptake = 5.1 +/- 0.1 l/min) performed three randomly assigned bouts of cycle ergometer exercise (60% maximal O2 uptake) in the heat (40 degrees C) until volitional exhaustion. To determine the influence of rate of heat storage (0.10 vs. 0.05 degrees C/min induced by a water-perfused jacket), four cyclists performed two additional exercise bouts, starting with Tes of 37.0 degrees C. Despite different initial temperatures, all subjects fatigued at an identical level of hyperthermia (Tes = 40. 1-40.2 degrees C, muscle temperature = 40.7-40.9 degrees C, skin temperature = 37.0-37.2 degrees C) and cardiovascular strain (heart rate = 196-198 beats/min, cardiac output = 19.9-20.8 l/min). Time to exhaustion was inversely related to the initial body temperature: 63 +/- 3, 46 +/- 3, and 28 +/- 2 min with initial Tes of approximately 36, 37, and 38 degrees C, respectively (all P < 0.05). Similarly, with different rates of heat storage, all subjects reached exhaustion at similar Tes and muscle temperature (40.1-40.3 and 40. 7-40.9 degrees C, respectively), but with significantly different skin temperature (38.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 35.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C during high vs. low rate of heat storage, respectively, P < 0.05). Time to exhaustion was significantly shorter at the high than at the lower rate of heat storage (31 +/- 4 vs. 56 +/- 11 min, respectively, P < 0.05). Increases in heart rate and reductions in stroke volume paralleled the rise in core temperature (36-40 degrees C), with skin blood flow plateauing at Tes of approximately 38 degrees C. These results demonstrate that high internal body temperature per se causes fatigue in trained subjects during prolonged exercise in uncompensable hot environments. Furthermore, time to exhaustion in hot environments is inversely related to the initial temperature and directly related to the rate of heat storage.

AB  - BACKGROUND- Simultaneous contribution of hundreds of electrocardiographic (ECG) biomarkers to prediction of long-term mortality in postmenopausal women with clinically normal resting ECGs is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS- We analyzed ECGs and all-cause mortality in 33 144 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative trials who were without baseline cardiovascular disease or cancer and had normal ECGs by Minnesota and Novacode criteria. Four hundred and seventy-seven ECG biomarkers, encompassing global and individual ECG findings, were measured with computer algorithms. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years (range for survivors, 0.5 to 11.2 years), 1229 women died. For analyses, the cohort was randomly split into derivation (n=22 096; deaths, 819) and validation (n=11 048; deaths, 410) subsets. ECG biomarkers and demographic and clinical characteristics were simultaneously analyzed using both traditional Cox regression and random survival forest, a novel algorithmic machine-learning approach. Regression modeling failed to converge. Random survival forest variable selection yielded 20 variables that were independently predictive of long-term mortality, 14 of which were ECG biomarkers related to autonomic tone, atrial conduction, and ventricular depolarization and repolarization. CONCLUSIONS- We identified 14 ECG biomarkers from among hundreds that were associated with long-term prognosis using a novel random forest variable selection methodology. These biomarkers were related to autonomic tone, atrial conduction, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization. Quantitative ECG biomarkers have prognostic importance and may be markers of subclinical disease in apparently healthy postmenopausal women.

AB  - Due to the potential anti-inflammatory properties of fish-derived long chain n-3 fatty acids, it has been suggested that athletes should regularly consume fish oils-although evidence in support of this recommendation is not clear. While fish oils can positively modulate immune function, it remains possible that, due to their high number of double bonds, there may be concurrent increases in lipid peroxidation. The current study aims to investigate the effect of fish oil supplementation on exercise-induced markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage. Twenty males underwent a 6-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled supplementation trial involving two groups (fish oil or placebo). After supplementation, participants undertook 200 repetitions of eccentric knee contractions. Blood samples were taken presupplementation, postsupplementation, immediately, 24, 48, and 72 hr postexercise and muscle soreness/maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) assessed. There were no differences in creatine kinase, protein carbonyls, endogenous DNA damage, muscle soreness or MVC between groups. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were lower (p < .05) at 48 and 72 hr post exercise and H2O2 stimulated DNA damage was lower (p < .05) immediately postexercise in the fish oil, compared with the control group. The current study demonstrates that fish oil supplementation reduces selected markers of oxidative stress after a single bout of eccentric exercise.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the airway mechanics of modified toggle LP constructs in an airflow chamber model and compare these to the airway mechanics of standard LP constructs. Study design Ex-vivo experimental study. Sample population Fifty-one equine cadaveric larynges. Methods Bilateral LP constructs were performed using a modified toggle (n = 23) or a standard (n = 21) LP technique. Constructs were tested in an airflow model before and after cyclic loading which was designed to mimic postoperative swallowing. The cross-sectional area (CSA), peak translaryngeal airflow (L/s), and impedance (cmH20/L/s) were determined and compared between LP constructs before and after cycling. Results The mean CSA of the rima glottidis of the modified toggle LP constructs was 15.2 ± 2.6 cm2 before and 14.7 ± 2.6 cm2 after cyclic loading, and the mean CSA of the rima glottidis of the standard LP constructs was 16.4 ± 2.9 cm2 before and 15.7 ± 2.8 cm2 after cyclic loading. The modified toggle LP constructs had similar peak translaryngeal impedance before and after cyclic loading (p = .13); however, the standard LP constructs had higher peak translaryngeal impedance after cyclic loading (p = .02). Conclusion The modified toggle and standard LP constructs had comparable airway mechanics in an ex-vivo model. Clinical significance Further investigation is warranted to determine the extent to which the modified toggle LP technique restores normal airway function in horses with RLN.

Similar activation occurred in the SC in neck extension plus rotation. The ES was activated at over 40% MVC for 25% of the engagement duration. Post- sortie, 35% reduction in neck muscle strength occurred. <b xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Extreme neck extension ± rotation is very common in air combat and is associated with high levels of muscle activation and fatigue. This information can be used to help devise targeted neck conditioning and positioning strategies in order to reduce injury risk.

AB  - Exosomes are 40-150 nm extracellular vesicles that are released from a multitude of cell types, and perform diverse cellular functions including intercellular communication, antigen presentation, and transfer of tumorigenic proteins, mRNA and miRNA. Exosomes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. In this chapter, we reveal the protocol and key insights into the isolation, purification and characterization of exosomes, distinct from shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, a comprehensive evaluation of exosome isolation methods including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep™ density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) were examined. All exosome isolation methodologies contained 40-150 nm vesicles based on electron microscopy, and positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on immunoblotting. This protocol employed a proteomic profiling approach to characterize the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in exosome isolation. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, IAC-Exos was shown to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. However, the use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to antibody availability and suitability of exosome markers).

AB  - This study examined the following: effects of simulated firefighting (FF) activities under heat stress on sustained attention; whether incident rehabilitation (IR) influences performance; and relationships between performance, affect and personality. Firefighters performed ~18 min of FF. Attention, physiological, perceptual and psychological assessments were made before and after FF, IR and recovery. IR had no effects. Self-rated Energy increased, Tiredness decreased and Anxiety increased immediately post-FF; all returned to baseline 120 min post. The immediate effect of FF was faster reaction time (RT) followed by slowing after recovery. Perceived Energy at baseline was associated (p-values < 0.05) with faster and Tiredness with slower post-FF RTs; Accuracy was unaffected. Conscientiousness was negatively associated with RT before and 120 min following FF. RTs were faster following FF, accuracy was unchanged. Higher baseline Energy/lower Tiredness were associated with faster, less variable RTs at baseline and post-FF. Those with higher Conscientiousness had faster RTs. Research should further investigate higher-level cognitive processing following, or ideally during, FF.

AB  - Trekking and military missions generally consist of carrying heavy loads for extreme durations. These factors have been separately shown to be sources of neuromuscular (NM) fatigue and locomotor alterations. However, the question of their combined effects remains unresolved, and addressing this issue required a representative context. PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate the effects of extreme-duration heavy load carriage on NM function and walking characteristics. METHODS: Ten experienced infantrymen performed a 21-h simulated military mission (SMM) in a middle-mountain environment with equipment weighing approximately 27 kg during battles and approximately 43 kg during marches. NM function was evaluated for knee extensors (KE) and plantar flexors (PF) pre- and immediately post-SMM using isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) measurement, neural electrical stimulation and surface EMG. The twitch-interpolation method was used to assess central fatigue. Peripheral changes were examined by stimulating the muscle in the relaxed state. The energy cost, mechanical work and spatio-temporal pattern of walking were also evaluated pre-/post-SMM on an instrumented treadmill in three equipment conditions: Sportswear, Battle and March. RESULTS: After the SMM, MVC declined by -10.2+/-3.6% for KE (P<0.01) and -10.7+/-16.1% for PF (P = 0.06). The origin of fatigue was essentially peripheral for both muscle groups. A trend toward low-frequency fatigue was detected for KE (5.5%, P = 0.08). These moderate NM alterations were concomitant with a large increase in perceived fatigue from pre- (rating of 8.3+/-2.2) to post-SMM (15.9+/-2.1, P<0.01). The SMM-related fatigue did not alter walking energetics or mechanics, and the different equipment carried on the treadmill did not interact with this fatigue either. CONCLUSION: this study reports the first data on physiological and biomechanical consequences of extreme-duration heavy load carriage. Unexpectedly, NM function alterations due to the 21-h SMM were moderate and did not alter walking characteristics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Name: Effect of prolonged military exercises with high load carriage on neuromuscular fatigue and physiological/biomechanical responses. Number: NCT01127191.

AB  - In the military context, soldiers carry equipments of total mass often exceeding 30%-40% of their body mass (BM) and complexly distributed around their body (backpack, weapons, electronics, protections, etc.), which represents severe load carrying conditions. PURPOSE: This study aimed to better understand the effects of load carriage on walking energetics and mechanics during military-type walking. METHODS: Ten male infantrymen recently retired from the French Foreign Legion performed 3-min walking trials at a constant speed of 4 km.h(-1) on an instrumented treadmill, during which walking pattern spatiotemporal parameters, energy cost (C(W)), external mechanical work (W(ext)), and the work done by one leg against the other during the double-contact period (W(int,dc)) were specifically assessed. Three conditions were tested: (i) light sportswear (SP, reference condition considered as unloaded), (ii) battle equipment (BT, approximately 22 kg, approximately 27% of subjects' BM, corresponding to a military intermediate load), and (iii) road march equipment (RM, approximately 38 kg, approximately 46% of subjects' BM, corresponding to a military high load). RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that military equipment carriage significantly (i) altered the spatiotemporal pattern of walking (all P < 0.01), (ii) increased absolute gross and net CW (P < 0.0001), and (iii) increased both absolute and mass-relative W(ext) (P < 0.01) and W(int,dc) (P < 0.0001) but did not alter the inverted pendulum recovery or locomotor efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Military equipments carriage induced significant changes in walking mechanics and energetics, but these effects appeared not greater than those reported with loads carried around the waist and close to the center of mass. This result was not expected because the latter has been hypothesized to be the optimal method of load carriage from a metabolic standpoint.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deficits in static postural control related to chronic ankle instability (CAI) and fatigue have been investigated separately, but little evidence links these factors to performance of dynamic postural control. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of fatigue and CAI on performance measures of a dynamic postural-control task, the Star Excursion Balance Test. DESIGN AND SETTING: For each of the 3 designated reaching directions, 4 separate 5 (condition) x 2 (time) x 2 (side) analyses of variance with a between factor of group (CAI, healthy) were calculated for normalized reach distance and maximal ankle-dorsiflexion, knee-flexion, and hip-flexion angles. All data were collected in the Athletic Training Research Laboratory. SUBJECTS: Thirty subjects (16 healthy, 14 CAI) participated. MEASUREMENTS: All subjects completed 5 testing sessions, during which sagittal-plane kinematics and reaching distances were recorded while they performed 3 reaching directions (anterior, medial, and posterior) of the Star Excursion Balance Test, with the same stance leg before and after different fatiguing conditions. The procedure was repeated for both legs during each session. RESULTS: The involved side of the CAI subjects displayed significantly smaller reach distance values and knee-flexion angles for all 3 reaching directions compared with the uninjured side and the healthy group. The effects of fatigue amplified this trend. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ankle instability and fatigue disrupted dynamic postural control, most notably by altering control of sagittal-plane joint angles proximal to the ankle.

AB  - A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with an innovative rucksack shape that provides a better distribution of its weight over the middle and lower parts of the back (device C: 6l, 13.7 kg) was compared with two conventional SCBA which differed from each other in volume and weight (A: 6l, 15 kg, B: 6.8l, 11.7 kg). Twelve fire-fighters (27-49 yr) performed three exercises while using the three SCBA in a systematically permuted sequence. The exercises consisted of simulated rescue work under natural climatic conditions in a dwelling on the second floor and several typical elements of severe fire-fighting actions. Duration, heart rate, breathing frequency, rectal temperature, and sweat loss were recorded. Perceived exertion was rated and the carrying features of the SCBA were subjectively evaluated. The exercise was executed faster with the rucksack device, heart rates were then lower and the carrying features were evaluated as better. Thus, the weight of the SCBA was shown to be less important than its distribution.

AB  - Background Firefighting is a hazardous profession and firefighters suffer workplace injury at a higher rate than most US workers. Decreased physical fitness is associated with injury in firefighters. A physical fitness intervention was implemented among Tucson Fire Department recruit firefighters with the goals of decreasing injury and compensation claims frequency and costs during the recruit academy, and over the subsequent probationary year.Methods Department injury records were analysed and described by body part, injury type and mechanism of injury. Injury and workers’ compensation claims outcomes from the recruit academy initiation through the 12-month probationary period for the intervention recruit class were compared with controls from three historical classes.Results The majority of injuries were sprains and strains (65.4%), the most common mechanism of injury was acute overexertion (67.9%) and the lower extremity was the most commonly affected body region (61.7%). The intervention class experienced significantly fewer injuries overall and during the probationary year (p=0.009), filed fewer claims (p=0.028) and experienced claims cost savings of approximately US$33 000 (2013) from avoided injury and reduced claims costs. The estimated costs for programme implementation were $32 192 leading to a 1-year return on investment of 2.4%.Conclusions We observed reductions in injury occurrence and compensation costs among Probationary Firefighter Fitness (PFF-Fit) programme participants compared with historical controls. The initiation of the PFF-Fit programme has demonstrated promise in reducing injury and claims costs; however, continued research is needed to better understand the programme's potential effectiveness with additional recruit classes and carryover effects into the recruit's career injury potential.

AB  - The effective management of patients with breast cancer (BC) depends on the early diagnosis of the disease. Currently, BC diagnosis is based on diagnostic imaging and biopsy, while the use of non-invasive circulating biomarkers for diagnosis remains an unmet need. Among the plethora of proposed non-invasive biomarkers, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered promising diagnostic molecules because they are very stable in biological fluids and easily detectable. Although the discovery of miRNAs has opened a new avenue for their clinical application, the clinical translatability of these molecules remains unclear. This review analyses the role of circulating miRNAs as BC diagnostic biomarkers and focuses on two essential requirements to evaluate their clinical validity: i) Specificity and ii) consistent expression between the blood and tissue. These two issues were analyzed in depth using the Human miRNA Disease Database (HMDD v3.0) and the free search engine PubMed. One hundred and sixty three BC-associated miRNAs were selected and analyzed for their specificity among all human pathologies that shared deregulation (291) and consistent expression in the bloodstream and the tissue. In addition, we provide an overview of the current clinical trials examining miRNAs in BC. In conclusion, we highlight pitfalls in the translatability of circulating miRNAs into clinical practice due to the lack of specificity and a consistent expression pattern between the tissue and blood.

AB  - Proteins have proven to be particularly attractive as effective ligands in the synthesis of nano- and subnanoscaled materials because of their multiple chelating and functional groups imparting unique functionalities. However, protein-directed fluorescent metal cluster synthesis is still a challenge but a promising area of research. Here, we report on the synthesis of new water-soluble, stable, fluorescent Ag clusters via a facile, green method using denatured bovine serum albumin (dBSA) as a stabilizing agent. The dBSA with its 35 free cysteine residues could contribute to polyvalent interactions with the Ag clusters and serve as effective stabilizing agents for these clusters. The as-prepared Ag clusters showed high fluorescence emission at ∼637 nm and were stable even in 1 M NaCl. The fluorescent Ag clusters were then used in the detection of Hg(2+) with high sensitivity and selectivity. The detection limit was 10 nM in the linear range from 10 nM to 5 μM.

AB  - Despite substantial improvements in therapeutic strategies, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Exosomes, extracellular vesicles with a lipid bilayer membrane of endosomal origin, have been the focus of a large body of research in CVD. Exosomes not only serve as carriers for signal molecules responsible for intercellular and interorgan communication underlying CVD pathophysiology but also are bioactive agents which are partly responsible for the therapeutic effect of stem cell therapy of CVD. We here review recent insights gained into the role of exosomes in apoptosis, hypertrophy, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and inflammation in CVD pathophysiology and progression and the application and mechanisms of exosomes as therapeutic agents for CVD.

AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a new kind of persistent organic pollutant, is widely distributed in the environment and exists in various organisms, where it is also a neurotoxic compound. However, the potential mechanism of its neurotoxicity is still unclear. To examine the role of epigenetics in the neurotoxicity induced by PFOS, SK-N-SH cells were treated with different concentrations of PFOS or control medium (0.1% DMSO) for 48 h. The mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microRNA-16, microRNA-22, and microRNA-30a-5p were detected by Quantitative PCR (QPCR). Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to measure the protein levels of BDNF, and a western blot was applied to analyze the protein levels of DNMTs. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to detect the methylation status of the BDNF promoter I and IV. Results of MTT assays indicated that treatment with PFOS could lead to a significant decrease of cell viability, and the treated cells became shrunk. In addition, PFOS exposure decreased the expression of BDNF at mRNA and protein levels, increased the expression of microRNA-16, microRNA-22, microRNA-30a-5p, and decreased the expression of DNMT1 at mRNA and protein levels, but increased the expression of DNMT3b at mRNA and protein levels. Our results also demonstrate that PFOS exposure changes the methylation status of BDNF promoter I and IV. The findings of the present study suggest that methylation regulation of BDNF gene promoter and increases of BDNF-related-microRNA might underlie the mechanisms of PFOS-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High intensity functional training (HIFT) programs are designed to address multiple fitness domains, potentially providing improved physical and mental readiness in a changing operational environment. Programs consistent with HIFT principals such as CrossFit, SEALFIT and the US Marine Corps' High Intensity Tactical Training (HITT) are increasingly popular among military personnel. The goal of HIFT programs is to produce high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance and strength that exceed those achieved by following current physical activity recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Given the investment in and popularity of HIFT in the military, it is important to consider the potential impact of this approach to fitness training for the health of military personnel and their risk of training injury. In a previous report in this journal, we addressed the question of whether HIFT was associated with higher injury rates compared to other exercise programs. We argued that concerns about the injury potential of HIFT exercise programs were not supported by the scientific literature to date, although additional research was needed to directly compare injury rates in approaches such as CrossFit to traditional military fitness programs. In this article we will review the scientific data on the practical, health and fitness benefits of HIFT exercise programs for military populations. RESULTS: Practical benefits to HIFT exercise programs include shorter training times and volumes, exercises which simulate combat tasks, lower equipment costs, reduced potential for boredom and adaptation as a result of constant variation, less injury potential compared to high volume endurance training, and scalability to all fitness levels and rehabilitation needs. For instance, HIFT training volumes are typically between 25% to nearly 80% less than traditional military fitness programs without reductions in fitness outcomes. HIFT program also provide an impressive range of health benefits such as the promotion of metabolic conditioning and muscular strength, less systemic inflammation or oxidative damage compared to sustained aerobic activity, and promoting general physical preparedness (GPP) for the unpredictable physical demands of combat. CONCLUSION: Given the unique benefits of HIFT, we recommend that these programs become the standard for military physical training. Despite the promise of HIFT fitness programs, questions remain about implementing these programs in the military context. For instance, no large scale randomized trials comparing traditional military physical training with HIFT programs on both health and injury outcomes have been conducted. Such a trial could identify key elements from both types of programs which should be incorporated in future approaches to military fitness training. Also, research regarding the optimal ways of implementing HIFT to maximize both GPP and combat oriented physical skills is lacking. It is likely that an approach to HIFT training which promotes GPP for all personnel along with specialized elements selected on the basis of individual occupation demands would be maximally disseminable in the military.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Given high levels of occupational stress and toxic exposures, firefighters have a relatively high prevalence of occupationally related medical and mental health disorders compared with the general public. Previous research found high rates of heavy and binge drinking among male firefighters. This study is the first to examine alcohol use among women firefighters. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a national online survey of women, career firefighters. RESULTS: A total of 1,913 women firefighters completed questions regarding alcohol use. Nearly 40% reported binge drinking in the previous month and 4.3% reported driving while intoxicated. Among those who drank, 16.5% screened positive for problem drinking. Problem drinkers were more than 2.5 times as likely to have been diagnosed with depression or have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, and were approximately 40% more likely to have been injured on the job in the previous year, when compared with other women firefighters. Those who screened positive for problem drinking also were significantly less likely to say that they would recommend a fire service career to other women. CONCLUSIONS: As with male firefighters, heavy and problem drinking are prevalent among women firefighters and are associated with negative occupational outcomes.

AB  - Performance in fitness tests could depend on factors beyond the bioenergetic and skeletomuscular systems, such as individual differences in preference for and tolerance of different levels of exercise-induced somatosensory stimulation. Although such individual-difference variables could play a role in exercise testing and prescription, they have been understudied. The purpose of these studies was to examine the relationships of self-reported preference for and tolerance of exercise intensity with performance in fitness tests. Participants in study I were 516 men and women volunteers from a campus community, and participants in study II were 42 men recruit firefighters undergoing a 6-week training program. Both the Preference and Tolerance scores exhibited significant relationships with performance in several fitness tests and with body composition and physical activity participation. Preference and Tolerance did not change after the training program in study II, despite improvements in objective and perceived fitness, supporting their conceptualization as dispositional traits. Preference and Tolerance scores could be useful not only in ameliorating the current understanding of the determinants of physical performance, but also in personalizing exercise prescriptions and, thus, delivering exercise experiences that are more pleasant, tolerable, and sustainable.

RN  - 12 healthy young, and 10 healthy old adults each completed 5 stair descent trials on a seven step staircase (rise 17.8cm, run 27.9 cm) with 3 and 100lx ambient light levels. Swing limb step clearance was measured. Approach distance was 2m and subjects proceeded down the stairs at 0.65m/s (comfortable descent speed for older adults). Trials above and below 0.69 and 0.61 m/s were rejected until 5 successes were obtained. Subjects wore the same brand of shoes with 4 reflective markers. A microscribe digitizer was used to digitize 300 points on the sole and 10 points on each reflective marker. Three of the four markers were used to define a local shoe coordinate system (this allowed them to see the distance from the shoe markers, to the true outsole with reported resolution of 0.38mm). When the global and local shoe coordinate systems were combined, the minimum clearance across all frames was recorded (they didn’t just look at distance between the middle of the foot (or toe or heel) and the stair edge. ANOVA was done to determine differences between subjects and conditions.

AB  - CONTEXT: Heightened cardiovascular responses to mental stressors are associated with future risk of hypertension. The role of cortisol, a key stress hormone produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the association between cortisol responses to laboratory-induced mental stress and incident hypertension. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective substudy of the Whitehall II cohort with 3 years follow-up of an occupational cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 479 initially healthy men and women (mean age, 62.7 ± 5.6 yr), without history or objective signs of cardiovascular disease or hypertension at study entry. INTERVENTION: At the baseline assessment, salivary cortisol was measured in response to mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure was measured at study entry and at 3 yr follow-up for the determination of hypertension. RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the cortisol stress response, with approximately 40% of the sample responding to the stress tasks with an increase in cortisol of at least 1 mmol/liter. Over the 3 yr follow-up, 15.9% of the sample developed hypertension. There was an association between cortisol stress reactivity (per sd) and incident hypertension (odds ratio = 1.59; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-2.17) after adjustments for age, sex, resting cortisol, blood pressure at study entry, employment grade, smoking, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, use of statins, and blood lipids. CONCLUSION: These data support the notion that cortisol reactivity, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Arterial stiffness and wave reflection parameters assessed from both invasive and non-invasive pressure and flow readings are used as surrogates for ventricular and vascular load. They have been reported to predict adverse cardiovascular events, but clinical assessment is laborious and may limit widespread use. This study aims to investigate measures of arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics provided by arterial tonometry alone and in combination with aortic root flows derived by echocardiography against surrogates derived by a mathematical pressure and flow model in a healthy middle-aged cohort. METHODS: Measurements of carotid artery tonometry and echocardiography were performed on 2226 ASKLEPIOS study participants and parameters of systemic hemodynamics, arterial stiffness and wave reflection based on pressure and flow were measured. In a second step, the analysis was repeated but echocardiography derived flows were substituted by flows provided by a novel mathematical model. This was followed by a quantitative method comparison. RESULTS: All investigated parameters showed a significant association between the methods. Overall agreement was acceptable for all parameters (mean differences: -0.0102 (0.033 SD) mmHg*s/ml for characteristic impedance, 0.36 (4.21 SD) mmHg for forward pressure amplitude, 2.26 (3.51 SD) mmHg for backward pressure amplitude and 0.717 (1.25 SD) m/s for pulse wave velocity). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the use of model-based surrogates in a healthy middle aged cohort is feasible and deserves further attention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, a novel method to estimate aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) noninvasively from an oscillometric single brachial cuff waveform reading has been introduced. We investigated whether this new approach provides acceptable estimates of aPWV compared with intra-aortic catheter measurements. METHODS: Estimated values of aPWV obtained from brachial cuff readings were compared with those obtained using an intra-aortic catheter in 120 patients (mean age 61.8±10.8 years) suspected for coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. Differences between aPWV values obtained from the test device and those obtained from catheter measurements were estimated using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The mean difference±SD between brachial cuff-derived values and intra-aortic values was 0.43±1.24 m/s. Comparison of aPWV measured by the two methods showed a significant linear correlation (Pearson's R=0.81, P<0.0001). The mean difference for repeated oscillometric measurements of aPWV was 0.05 m/s, with 95% confidence interval limits from -0.47 to 0.57 m/s. CONCLUSION: aPWV can be obtained using an oscillometric device with brachial cuffs with acceptable accuracy compared with intra-aortic readings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: microRNAs are promising candidate breast cancer biomarkers due to their cancer-specific expression profiles. However, efforts to develop circulating breast cancer biomarkers are challenged by the heterogeneity of microRNAs in the blood. To overcome this challenge, we aimed to develop a molecular profile of microRNAs specifically secreted from breast cancer cells. Our first step towards this direction relates to capturing and analyzing the contents of exosomes, which are small secretory vesicles that selectively encapsulate microRNAs indicative of their cell of origin. To our knowledge, circulating exosome microRNAs have not been well-evaluated as biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis or monitoring. METHODS: Exosomes were collected from the conditioned media of human breast cancer cell lines, mouse plasma of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models (PDX), and human plasma samples. Exosomes were verified by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. Cellular and exosome microRNAs from breast cancer cell lines were profiled by next-generation small RNA sequencing. Plasma exosome microRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis showed that several microRNAs are selectively encapsulated or highly enriched in breast cancer exosomes. Importantly, the selectively enriched exosome microRNA, human miR-1246, was detected at significantly higher levels in exosomes isolated from PDX mouse plasma, indicating that tumor exosome microRNAs are released into the circulation and can serve as plasma biomarkers for breast cancer. This observation was extended to human plasma samples where miR-1246 and miR-21 were detected at significantly higher levels in the plasma exosomes of 16 patients with breast cancer as compared to the plasma exosomes of healthy control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the combination of plasma exosome miR-1246 and miR-21 is a better indicator of breast cancer than their individual levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that certain microRNA species, such as miR-21 and miR-1246, are selectively enriched in human breast cancer exosomes and significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with breast cancer. These findings indicate a potential new strategy to selectively analyze plasma breast cancer microRNAs indicative of the presence of breast cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Night vision goggles (NVG) are linked to increased neck muscle activation and pain. Counterweights (NVGcw) are hypothesized to mitigate these effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscular response to varying helmet loads and postures. METHODS: Volunteering from a representative squadron were 16 male helicopter aviators (pilots, N = 9; flight engineers, N = 7). Subjects performed head movements to assume nine different postures (three directions: left, center, and right, at three different levels: down, level, and up) with four different head loads (no helmet; helmet only; NVG; and NVGcw) in randomized order. Subjects were provided real time visual guidance and feedback while assuming the appropriate posture in a cockpit seat in a laboratory setting. Neck muscle activation was assessed with electromyography (EMG) of four different muscle groups, bilaterally, including the sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and mid and lower trapezius. RESULTS: Two- to fourfold increases in muscle activation were observed in postures to the left (down, level, and up) while subjects wore either the NVG or NVGcw as compared to the baseline of no helmet. This was most prevalent in smaller muscle groups (i.e., the sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis) as compared to larger muscle groups (i.e., the mid and lower trapezius). DISCUSSION: The use of NVGcw did not decrease neck muscle activity as compared to NVG only, particularly when the head posture moved the field of view below the horizon. This suggests interventions to decrease neck muscle activity and fatigue in military helicopter aircrew using NVG should focus on task specific guidelines with respect to countermeasures.

AB  - NASA-TLX is a multi-dimensional scale designed to obtain workload estimates from one or more operators while they are performing a task or immediately afterwards. The years of research that preceded subscale selection and the weighted averaging approach resulted in a tool that has proven to be reasonably easy to use and reliably sensitive to experimentally important manipulations over the past 20 years. Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned

AB  - The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload.

AB  - We examined the oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) during completion of a circuit developed for testing fire fighters and related performance time to laboratory measures of fitness. Twenty-two healthy university students (ten women) were trained in the tasks then performed the circuit as quickly as possible. Breath-by-breath gas exchange and heart rate were continuously measured with a portable system. Median circuit time was 6:13 (min:s, 25-75% = 5:46-6:42) for men and 7:25 (25-75% = 6:49-10:21) for 8 women finishers (P = 0.023), and VO2 averaged 68 and 64% VO2max for the men and women during the circuit. Both men and women had high respiratory exchange ratios (>1.0) suggesting marked anaerobic energy contribution. Physiological variables associated with circuit time were assessed by backward stepwise regression yielding a significant model that included only peak work rate during arm cranking exercise as a function of circuit completion time across men and women combined (P < 0.001). For men, but especially for women, the time required for the simulated victim drag (68.2 kg mannequin) was positively correlated with total time to complete the other circuit elements (r = 0.51, r = 0.96 respectively). The simple correlation between circuit time and VO2max (mL/kg/min) revealed poor relationships for men (r = -0.37, P > 0.05) and women (r = 0.20, P > 0.05). These data demonstrated that upper body fitness as reflected by peak work rate during arm cranking correlated with total circuit time for the men and women in our population sample.

AB  - Adult skeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to regenerate following myotrauma. Because adult myofibers are terminally differentiated, the regeneration of skeletal muscle is largely dependent on a small population of resident cells termed satellite cells. Although this population of cells was identified 40 years ago, little is known regarding the molecular phenotype or regulation of the satellite cell. The use of cell culture techniques and transgenic animal models has improved our understanding of this unique cell population; however, the capacity and potential of these cells remain ill-defined. This review will highlight the origin and unique markers of the satellite cell population, the regulation by growth factors, and the response to physiological and pathological stimuli. We conclude by highlighting the potential therapeutic uses of satellite cells and identifying future research goals for the study of satellite cell biology.

AB  - Skeletal muscle displays remarkable plasticity, enabling substantial adaptive modifications in its metabolic potential and functional characteristics in response to external stimuli such as mechanical loading and nutrient availability. Contraction-induced adaptations are determined largely by the mode of exercise and the volume, intensity, and frequency of the training stimulus. However, evidence is accumulating that nutrient availability serves as a potent modulator of many acute responses and chronic adaptations to both endurance and resistance exercise. Changes in macronutrient intake rapidly alter the concentration of blood-borne substrates and hormones, causing marked perturbations in the storage profile of skeletal muscle and other insulin-sensitive tissues. In turn, muscle energy status exerts profound effects on resting fuel metabolism and patterns of fuel utilization during exercise as well as acute regulatory processes underlying gene expression and cell signaling. As such, these nutrient-exercise interactions have the potential to activate or inhibit many biochemical pathways with putative roles in training adaptation. This review provides a contemporary perspective of our understanding of the molecular and cellular events that take place in skeletal muscle in response to both endurance and resistance exercise commenced after acute and/or chronic alterations in nutrient availability (carbohydrate, fat, protein, and several antioxidants). Emphasis is on the results of human studies and how nutrient provision (or lack thereof) interacts with specific contractile stimulus to modulate many of the acute responses to exercise, thereby potentially promoting or inhibiting subsequent training adaptation.

AB  - Team sport athletes face a variety of nutritional challenges related to recovery during the competitive season. The purpose of this article is to review nutrition strategies related to muscle regeneration, glycogen restoration, fatigue, physical and immune health, and preparation for subsequent training bouts and competitions. Given the limited opportunities to recover between training bouts and games throughout the competitive season, athletes must be deliberate in their recovery strategy. Foundational components of recovery related to protein, carbohydrates, and fluid have been extensively reviewed and accepted. Micronutrients and supplements that may be efficacious for promoting recovery include vitamin D, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, creatine, collagen/vitamin C, and antioxidants. Curcumin and bromelain may also provide a recovery benefit during the competitive season but future research is warranted prior to incorporating supplemental dosages into the athlete’s diet. Air travel poses nutritional challenges related to nutrient timing and quality. Incorporating strategies to consume efficacious micronutrients and ingredients is necessary to support athlete recovery in season.

AB  - There exists a large body of scientific evidence to support protein intakes in excess of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (0.8 g protein/kg/day) to promote the retention of skeletal muscle and loss of adipose tissue during dietary energy restriction. Diet-induced weight loss with as low as possible ratio of skeletal muscle to fat mass loss is a situation we refer to as high-quality weight loss. We propose that high-quality weight loss is often of importance to elite athletes in order to maintain their muscle (engine) and shed unwanted fat mass, potentially improving athletic performance. Current recommendations for protein intakes during weight loss in athletes are set at 1.6-2.4 g protein/kg/day. However, the severity of the caloric deficit and type and intensity of training performed by the athlete will influence at what end of this range athletes choose to be. Other considerations regarding protein intake that may help elite athletes achieve weight loss goals include the quality of protein consumed, and the timing and distribution of protein intake throughout the day. This review highlights the scientific evidence used to support protein recommendations for high-quality weight loss and preservation of performance in athletes. Additionally, the current knowledge surrounding the use of protein supplements, branched chain amino acids (BCAA), beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), and other dietary supplements with weight loss claims will be discussed.

AB  - We examined arterial stiffness, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability after an acute bout of aerobic exercise compared to resistance exercise. We hypothesized that arterial stiffness would be reduced after aerobic exercise, while it would be increased after resistance exercise, and these alterations would be associated with differential changes in BRS and SAP variability. Arterial stiffness, BRS, and SAP variability were assessed before and 20 min after a bout of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise in 13 male participants. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was used to measure central (carotid-femoral) and peripheral (femoral-dorsalis pedis) arterial stiffness. BRS was derived via the sequence technique. Spectral decomposition of beat-to-beat SAP variability was used as an estimate of sympathetic vasomotor tone. A mode-by-time interaction (p < 0.001) was detected for central PWV, due to an increase in PWV (p < 0.05) following resistance exercise and a decrease in PWV following aerobic exercise (p < 0.05). A mode-by-time interaction was also detected for peripheral PWV (p < 0.05), due to a decrease in peripheral PWV following aerobic exercise (p < 0.05) with no change following resistance exercise. BRS was significantly lower following resistance compared with aerobic exercise (p < 0.004). SAP variability increased following resistance exercise (p < 0.05) but there was no interaction. In conclusion, aerobic exercise decreased both central and peripheral arterial stiffness, while resistance exercise significantly increased central arterial stiffness only. BRS was reduced after both bouts of exercise, but significantly greater reductions were seen following resistance exercise.

AB  - PURPOSE: Resistance training increases arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflection. We tested the hypothesis that potentially greater tonic arterial stiffness in resistance-trained (RT) men may alter the vascular response to an acute exercise stressor. METHODS: Thirty participants (age 22 +/- 0.5 yr; 15 highly RT men and 15 sedentary non-RT men) underwent measures of central (carotid femoral) and peripheral (femoral dorsalis pedis) pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx; index of central pressure wave reflection derived from radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis) before and 10, 20, and 30 min after maximal aerobic exercise. RESULTS: RT men were significantly stronger (bench press 143 +/- 7 vs 85 +/- 2 kg, P < 0.05) and heavier (93 +/- 3 vs 82 +/- 3 kg, P < 0.05) than sedentary men. Groups did not differ in resting central/peripheral PWV or in AIx. AIx was not changed at 10 min after maximal aerobic exercise in both groups and was reduced similarly in both groups at 20 and 30 min after maximal aerobic exercise (P < 0.05). Peripheral PWV decreased similarly at all time points after maximal aerobic exercise in both groups and was not recovered by 30 min (P < 0.05). There was no change in central PWV after maximal aerobic exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The arterial response to maximal aerobic exercise was similar in highly RT and non-RT men. There was no change in intensity of central pressure wave reflection 10 min after exercise, despite significant reductions in peripheral muscular artery stiffness. Arterial reactivity to an acute exercise stressor is not impaired in young, highly RT men.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison. OBJECTIVE: To examine gender differences in rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), an index of ventricular depolarization/repolarization, in young, trained men and women with lower spinal cord injury (SCI) and able-bodied (AB) controls. SETTING: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Exercise and Cardiovascular Research Lab, USA. METHODS: Subjects consisted of 16 athletes with SCI (eight men and eight women) and 16 age-matched AB active controls (eight men and eight women). QT interval dynamics was derived from ECG recordings and rate corrected using the Bazett formula. RESULTS: Men with SCI had QTc similar to that of AB men (369.3+/-7.5 versus 357.9+/-3.0 ms, P>0.05). Women with SCI had QTc similar to that of AB women (400.0+/-4.6 versus 385.2+/-6.5 ms, P>0.05). AB women had longer QTc interval than AB men, and SCI women had longer QTc than SCI men (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in ventricular depolarization/repolarization are present in trained individuals with SCI. Thus, similar to their AB gender-matched peers, women with SCI have longer QTc intervals and may be at greater risk for the development of untoward cardiac arrhythmias than men with SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The kinetics of parasympathetic reactivation after dynamic endurance exercise have been well elucidated. However, autonomic recovery of cardiac function after resistance exercise is not known. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess cardiac autonomic modulations during recovery from acute resistance exercise versus acute endurance exercise. METHODS: Electrocardiogram readings were collected before and 30 min after a single bout of endurance or resistance exercise in 14 male participants (aged 25.3+/-2.5 years). Heart rate (HR) variability was spectrally decomposed using an autoregressive approach. High frequency (HF) power was considered representative of vagal modulation. All values were expressed in both absolute and normalized units (normalized for change in total power). RESULTS: A mode-by-time interaction (P<0.05) was detected for HR, which remained elevated to a greater extent after resistance exercise. Total power was significantly reduced after resistance exercise (P<0.05) but not endurance exercise. An interaction (P<0.05) was also detected for both a change in absolute natural log function HF power and natural log function low frequency (LF) power (P<0.05), as both variables decreased more after resistance exercise. When normalized for changes in total power, interactions in LF and HF power were lost. The LF/HF ratio was significantly increased after both resistance and endurance exercise (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Greater elevations in HR after acute resistance exercise versus acute endurance exercise may be related to greater reductions in cardiac parasympathetic tone.

AB  - Acute resistance exercise (RE) has been shown to reduce cardiac vagal control. Whether this would in turn affect QTc interval (an index of ventricular depolarization/repolarization) or heart rate complexity is not known. Heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate complexity (SampEn), and QT interval (rate corrected using Bazett, Fridericia, Hodges, and Framingham) were measured before and 5 min after an acute RE bout in twelve healthy young men. Normalized high frequency power of HRV (an index of cardiac parasympathetic modulation; HF (nu)), and SampEn were reduced following RE (p < 0.05). Bazett corrected QTc interval increased following RE (p < 0.05). Change in HF (nu) from rest to recovery was correlated with both change in SampEn (r = 0.51, p < 0.05) and change in QTc interval for each method of correction (r = - 0.67 to - 0.70, p < 0.05). Acute RE reduced HF spectral power of HRV and this was related to both reduced heart rate complexity and increased QTc length. Thus, during recovery from acute RE, there is prolongation of depolarization and repolarization of the ventricles concomitant with reduced cardiac irregularity, and this may be related to a reduction in cardiac vagal control.

AB  - This case-control study within a metropolitan fire department evaluated the effect of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and other risk factors on three types of injury at the scene of a fire (smoke inhalation, burns, and falls). Data on 75 injured fire fighters and 144 controls came from telephone interviews and department records. The two sets of uninjured fire-fighter controls were matched to cases on incident (n = 72) or on job position and fire type and size (n = 72). Smoke inhalation cases were not significantly different from controls in SCBA use, cigarette smoking, previous fires in the shift, or injury history. Jobs with high risk of burns included nozzle operator, engine officer, and forcible-entry person in first-due companies (OR = 20.1). Other risk factors for burns were: basement origin of fire (OR = 10.2); prior fire-fighting training outside the present department (same fire: OR = 11.2; similar fire: OR = 3.9); and on-duty injury in the prior 12 months (same fire: OR = 4.3; similar fire: OR = 3.5). When other risk factors were considered, consistent SCBA use was associated with falls (same fire: OR = 11.8; similar fire: OR = 4.3) but not with burns. Risk of falls also was elevated among members of truck companies (OR = 17.7) and fire fighters without children (same fire: OR = 8.4; similar fire: OR = 7.4). On-duty injury in the past 12 months was associated with falls when one compared cases with similar-fire controls (OR = 5.5), but not with controls attending the same fire. Neither age nor experience was related to injury in this population.

AB  - This report is unique in presenting a high-resolution dataset of biomass use, production, feed efficiencies, and greenhouse gas emissions by global livestock. This information will allow the global-change research community in enhancing our understanding of the sustainability of livestock systems and their role in food security, livelihoods and environmental sustainability.We present a unique, biologically consistent, spatially disaggregated global livestock dataset containing information on biomass use, production, feed efficiency, excretion, and greenhouse gas emissions for 28 regions, 8 livestock production systems, 4 animal species (cattle, small ruminants, pigs, and poultry), and 3 livestock products (milk, meat, and eggs). The dataset contains over 50 new global maps containing high-resolution information for understanding the multiple roles (biophysical, economic, social) that livestock can play in different parts of the world. The dataset highlights: (i) feed efficiency as a key driver of productivity, resource use, and greenhouse gas emission intensities, with vast differences between production systems and animal products; (ii) the importance of grasslands as a global resource, supplying almost 50% of biomass for animals while continuing to be at the epicentre of land conversion processes; and (iii) the importance of mixed crop–livestock systems, producing the greater part of animal production (over 60%) in both the developed and the developing world. These data provide critical information for developing targeted, sustainable solutions for the livestock sector and its widely ranging contribution to the global food system.

AB  - Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but efficacy remains limited in most clinical settings. Cancer is a systemic disease that induces many functional and compositional changes to the immune system as a whole. Immunity is regulated by interactions of diverse cell lineages across tissues. Therefore, an improved understanding of tumour immunology must assess the systemic immune landscape beyond the tumour microenvironment (TME). Importantly, the peripheral immune system is required to drive effective natural and therapeutically induced antitumour immune responses. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that immunotherapy drives new immune responses rather than the reinvigoration of pre-existing immune responses. However, new immune responses in individuals burdened with tumours are compromised even beyond the TME. Herein, we aim to comprehensively outline the current knowledge of systemic immunity in cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular events are a leading cause of firefighter duty-related death, with the greatest risk occurring during or shortly after fire suppression activity. Increased cardiovascular risk potentially manifests from detrimental changes in ventricular function, vascular load, and their interaction, described as ventricular-vascular coupling. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of live-fire training on ventricular-vascular coupling. METHODS: Sixty-eight male (28 [Formula: see text] 7 years, 26.9 [Formula: see text] 3.9 kg/m(2)) and fifteen female (36 [Formula: see text] 8 years, 24.3 [Formula: see text] 3.9 kg/m(2)) firefighters completed hemodynamic and cardiac measures before and after 3 h of intermittent live-fire training. Left ventricular function was assessed as ejection fraction (EF) and ventricular elastance (E(LV): end systolic pressure [ESP]/end systolic volume) via echocardiography and applanation tonometry-estimated ESP. Vascular load was assessed as arterial elastance (E(A): ESP/stroke volume [SV]). Ventricular-vascular coupling (VVC) was quantified as the ratio of E(A) to E(LV) and indexed to body surface area (E(A)I, E(LV)I). RESULTS: Following firefighting EF decreased (p < 0.01) with no change in E(LV)I (p = 0.34). SV decreased (p < 0.01) with no change in ESP (p = 0.09), driving a significant increase in E(A)I (p < 0.01). These changes resulted in a significant increase in the VVC ratio (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that firefighting does not alter ventricular elastance but increases arterial elastance in healthy firefighters, resulting in a mismatch between ventricular and vascular systems. This increase in ventricular-vascular coupling ratio and concomitant reduction in ventricular systolic function may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk following live firefighting.

AB  - The ability to assess energy expenditure (EE) and estimate physical activity (PA) in free-living individuals is extremely important in the global context of non-communicable diseases including malnutrition, overnutrition (obesity), and diabetes. It is also important to appreciate that PA and EE are different constructs with PA defined as any bodily movement that results in EE and accordingly, energy is expended as a result of PA. However, total energy expenditure, best assessed using the criterion doubly labeled water (DLW) technique, includes components in addition to physical activity energy expenditure, namely resting energy expenditure and the thermic effect of food. Given the large number of assessment techniques currently used to estimate PA in humans, it is imperative to understand the relative merits of each. The goal of this review is to provide information on the utility and limitations of a range of objective measures of PA and their relationship with EE. The measures discussed include those based on EE or oxygen uptake including DLW, activity energy expenditure, physical activity level, and metabolic equivalent; those based on heart rate monitoring and motion sensors; and because of their widespread use, selected subjective measures.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine the influence of short-term intense endurance training on cycling performance, along with the acute and chronic signaling responses of skeletal muscle stress and stability markers. Ten recreationally active subjects (25 ± 2 yr, 79 ± 3 kg, 47 ± 2 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)) were studied before and after a 12-day cycling protocol to examine the effects of short-term intense (70-100% V̇o(2max)) exercise training on resting and exercise-induced regulation of molecular factors related to skeletal muscle cellular stress and protein stability. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken at rest and 3 h following a 20-km cycle time trial on days 1 and 12 to measure mRNA expression and protein content. Training improved (P < 0.05) cycling performance by 5 ± 1%. Protein oxidation was unaltered on day 12, while resting SAPK/JNK phosphorylation was reduced (P < 0.05), suggesting a reduction in cellular stress. The maintenance in the myocellular environment may be due to synthesis of cytoprotective markers, along with enhanced degradation of damage proteins, as training tended (P < 0.10) to increase resting protein content of manganese superoxide dismutase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), while mRNA expression of MuRF-1 was elevated (P < 0.05). Following training (day 12), the acute exercise-induced transcriptional response of TNF-α, NF-κB, MuRF-1, and PGC1α was attenuated (P < 0.05) compared with day 1 Collectively, these data suggest that short-term intense training enhances protein stability, creating a cellular environment capable of resistance to exercise-induced stress, which may be favorable for adaptation.

AB  - Four different fire protection jackets, five different sets of underwear (four functional and one cotton) and two compressed-air breathing devices of different weights which are independent of the ambient air were investigated comparatively under practice-oriented standardized laboratory conditions (climate chamber, treadmill) by four specially chosen and trained test subjects. As in phase I, the practical orientation was reflected in parameters climate, heaviness of work and use of breathing apparatus. The aim of phase II was to find out in a defined time and physical strain regime (submaximal strain) how the four fire protection jackets to be tested, the underwear and the compressed-air breathing apparatus perform with regard to the parameters heart rate, core body temperature, changes of microclimate, weight changes of subjects and clothing, and perceived comfort. On the basis of the above parameters, especially the skin temperature and skin moisture curves which are the most informative with regard to clothing physiology, the following ranking of the jackets was found: Mc Bean, Texport, Bristol and Teled. As expected, the functional underwear could not ranked on the basis of the experiments carried out by only one person. However, noticeable drying effects were shown in the person wearing the functional underwear. These facts are of course not manifested with cotton underwear. Combination of functional underwear and a protective jacket permeable to water vapor using a functional shirt as a substitute for the cotton shirt typical for uniforms can be recommended. This enables a functional interaction of the system as a whole. Reducing the weight of the compressed-air breathing apparatus had a positive effect on the exercise-dependent heart rate.

AB  - In an experiment with 10 different backpack configurations, the loss of physical performance due to weight and volume, restriction of shoulder motion, and interference with balance were quantified on a test battery. Ten well-trained infantry soldiers were subjected to several tests, including an obstacle course, jumping, sprinting, running, hand-grenade throwing, and a mobility test. On the test battery average losses of performance of 1% per kg mass and 0·2% per litre backpack volume were found. The effects of weight and volume on the physical performance were additive. Motion restriction of the shoulders did not result in significant performance losses. Balance disturbance resulted in a 1·5% performance decrement. In order to minimize the loss of physical performance, weight should be centred around the waist. Volume may be distributed over the chest and the back without extra performance decrements.

AB  - Fire fighting work comprises work tasks requiring an energy yield at maximal or close to maximal levels of the individual. Due to the very nature of fire fighting more complex physiological variables are difficult to measure. We measured metabolic and respiratory responses in 15 male, professional fire fighters during simulated work tasks on a test ground. Work time was on the average 22 min with individual components of work tasks lasting 2-4 min. The mean oxygen consumption for the whole exercise (22 min) was 2.75+/-0.29 l/min. The most demanding work task demanded an oxygen uptake of 3.55+/-0.27 l/min. Corresponding values for respiratory minute volumes were 82+/-14 and 102+/-14l/min, respectively. Heart rates averaged 168+/-12 for the whole test and 179+/-13 beats/min for the heaviest work task. Two new classes for classification of intensive and exhausting, short term physical work are proposed for inclusion in ISO8996 and values for relevant parameters are proposed.

AB  - Five students of a rescue training school cycled at 50 W for 20 min at 20 degrees C before walking at 5 km/hr up to 30 min in a climatic chamber at 55 degrees C and 30% relative humidity. 4 different types of clothing ensembles differing in terms of thickness and thermal insulation value were tested on separate days. All subjects completed 28-30 min in light clothing, but quit after 20-27 min in 3 firefighter ensembles due to a rectal temperature of 39.0 degrees C or subjective fatigue. No difference in the evolution of mean skin or rectal temperature was seen for the 3 turnout ensembles. Sweat production amounted to about 1000 g in the turnout gears of which less than 20% evaporated. It was concluded that the small differences between the turnout gears in terms of design, thickness and insulation value had no effect on the resulting heat physiological strain for the given experimental conditions.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss ranks among the most significant occupational health problems. In the United States, more than 1 million firefighters are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss due to exposure to hazardous levels of intermittent noise from sirens, air horns, and engines of emergency vehicles and fire trucks. Although irreversible, noise-induced hearing loss is entirely preventable through both engineering controls and personal protective equipment. This article describes occupational noise exposure, hearing loss, and strategies to prevent noise-induced hearing loss among firefighters.

AB  - The additional physiological strain associated with the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is mostly linked to the additional weight. Lightweight and conventional SCBA were assessed in a submaximal step test performed in full firekit (total weights 15 and 27 kg, respectively). Factors assessed were: comparative energy expenditure of the two sets, relationship between comparative energy expenditure and aerobic fitness and subjective discomfort. Measured variables were: oxygen consumption, heart rate, estimated VO2max and subjective discomfort (body part discomfort scale). The lightweight SCBA displayed a significant oxygen consumption benefit, which was independent of dynamic workrate and valued at 0.2561 min(-1). Mean heart rate responses were significantly lower with the light set. No relationship was found between comparative energy expenditure and aerobic fitness. The light set was rated as significantly more comfortable than the heavy. Further research is required to assess the extent of the energy consumption benefit in realistic fire suppression protocols and the contribution of ergonomic factors to the energy and comfort benefits.

AB  - During live-fire firefighting operations and training evolutions, firefighters often consume multiple cylinders of air and continue to wear their personal protective equipment even after fire suppression activities have ceased. However, most studies have only reported core temperature changes during short-term firefighting activities and have shown a very modest increase in core temperature. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate core temperature and heart rate (HR) during repeated bouts of firefighting activity over approximately 3 h. The results of this study show that core temperatures increase by an average of 1.9 degrees C--to a larger magnitude than previously reported--and continue to increase during subsequent work cycles (38.4 vs. 38.7) even after long breaks of more than 30 min. The rate of core temperature increase during work continues to increase later in the training exercise (from 0.036 to 0.048 degrees C/min), increasing the risk for exertional heat stress particularly if long-duration firefighting activity is required at these later times. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: To date, core temperature and HR changes during firefighting have been reported for short-term studies, which may significantly underestimate the physiological burden of typical firefighting activities. Firefighter core temperatures are shown to increase to a larger magnitude than previously observed and the rate of rise in core temperature increases during subsequent firefighting activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study reports measurements of hydration status among firefighters prior to training, documents changes in hydration status after prolonged firefighting training, and reports the utility of salivary measurements to assess changes in hydration in field environments. METHODS: Nude body mass measurements as well as urinary and salivary measurements of hydration status were taken before and after approximately three hours of firefighting training activities. Initial hydration status was assessed via urinary and salivary measures. Changes in body mass and total body water were measured following firefighting activity and correlated with changes in urinary and salivary measures of hydration. RESULTS: The most important findings of this study were that a high percentage of firefighters arrived at training in a significantly or seriously dehydrated state; that firefighters lost a significant amount of body mass because of firefighting operations; and that portable salivary osmolality measurements showed much stronger correlation with changes in hydration status after firefighting operations than standard urinary measurements did. CONCLUSIONS: Firefighters arriving in a dehydrated state are at risk for heat injuries and may be in a physically and/or psychologically compromised state at the outset of firefighter training. Even during cool autumn days with ample fluids available, firefighters experience dehydration during typical firefighting activities, so the ability to measure hydration status throughout such activities may be important. Our data suggest that quantification of changes in hydration status through salivary osmolality measurements may provide a viable field measurement tool for such activities.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe international fire service community is actively engaged in a wide range of activities focused on development, testing and implementation of effective approaches to reduce exposure to contaminants and the related cancer risk. However, these activities are often viewed independent of each other and in the absence of the larger overall effort of occupational health risk mitigation. This narrative review synthesizes the current research on fire service contamination control in the context of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Hierarchy of Controls, a framework that supports decision making around implementing feasible and effective control solutions in occupational settings. Using this approach, we identify evidence-based measures that have been investigated and that can be implemented to protect firefighters during an emergency response, in the fire apparatus and at the fire station, and identify several knowledge gaps that remain. While a great deal of research and development has been focused on improving personal protective equipment for the various risks faced by the fire service, these measures are lower in the Hierarchy of Controls, which are considered less effective. Administrative and engineering controls that can be used during and after the firefight have also received increased research interest in recent years. However, less research and development have been focused on higher level control measures such as engineering, substitution and elimination, which may be the most effective, but are challenging to implement. A comprehensive approach that considers each level of control and how it can be implemented, and that is mindful of the need to balance contamination risk reduction against the fire service mission to save lives and protect property, is likely to be the most effective.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to document the timeline of physiologic recovery from firefighting activities in order to inform emergency medical services (EMS) of vital sign values that might be expected during incident rehabilitation and in developing rehabilitation protocols to make decisions about when to return personnel to the fireground. Secondarily, we compared two different incident rehabilitation strategies to determine effectiveness in reducing physiologic strain following firefighting. METHODS: A repeated-measures randomized crossover design was utilized in which firefighters conducted a controlled set of firefighting activities, after which they completed incident rehabilitation in one of two conditions: 1) similar to currently used rehabilitation protocols and 2) with active cooling and nutritional intervention. Following 15 minutes of rehabilitation, each firefighter was asked to perform a simulated rescue "dummy drag" and then recover for 120 minutes in a quiet area. Core temperature and heart rate were recorded throughout the study. Blood pressures and subendocardial viability ratios were obtained before firefighting, after firefighting, and at standardized times during rehabilitation and recovery. RESULTS: Heart rate and core temperature increased during firefighting, and core temperature continued to increase for 7 minutes after completion of firefighting activities. These values did not return to baseline until at least 50 minutes after firefighting activity. Systolic blood pressures were significantly reduced during rehabilitation (15.2%), and recovered 7.7% during the first 30 minutes of recovery, but remained significantly lower than before firefighting for at least 120 minutes. An index of subendocardial perfusion was also significantly depressed for up to 110 minutes after firefighters. Differences between rehabilitation protocols were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: The timeline for recovery from firefighting activities is significantly longer than the typical 10-20-minute rehabilitation period that often is provided on the fireground. Modifications from the current rehabilitation protocol do not appear to improve the recovery timeline when rehabilitation is conducted in a cool room. While firefighters often are concerned about elevated blood pressures, this study suggests that firefighters and EMS personnel should also be cognizant of the potential dangers of hypotension.

AB  - The US fire service has become acutely aware of the need to clean PPE after fires. However, there is concern that damage from repeated cleaning may impact critical protection from fireground risk. Using a protocol that included repeated simulated fireground exposures (between 0 cycles and 40 cycles) and/or repeated cleaning with techniques common in the fire service, we found that several important protective properties of NFPA 1971 compliant turnout gear are significantly changed. Outer shell and thermal liner tear strength showed a statistically significant reduction when laundered as compared to wet or dry decontamination. Larger changes in outer shell tear strength resulted when the coat closure incorporated hook & dee clasps as compared with garments using zippered closures. Total Heat Loss was reduced for all samples that underwent any form of cleaning while Thermal Protective Performance was only increased in the gear that was laundered. These results suggest that some important protective properties of bunker gear can be decreased after repeated exposure/cleaning cycles relative to their levels when tested in a new condition. For the specific materials tested, outer shell trap tear strength in the fill direction and seam strength dropped below NFPA 1971 requirements after 40 laundering cycles. The findings for this study may have utility for setting preconditions for the measurement of certain performance properties in future editions of NFPA 1971.

AB  - Research on the performance of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the Fire Service is challenged by the ability to repeatedly and feasibly test new designs, interventions and wear trials in realistic conditions that appropriately simulate end use environments. To support firefighter PPE research and firefighter PPE acclimation/training, a multidisciplinary team has developed a low cost, easily replicable approach for simulating conditions commonly encountered by firefighters operating on the interior of a residential structure fire. The testing enclosure can be used with either stationary mannequins or firefighters conducting typical fireground activities, providing a method to study a wide range of PPE and physiological studies as well as training activities that may support developing new technologies and standardized testing opportunities. Environmental gas concentrations and firefighters’ local temperatures were measured during trials and compared to data collected from simulated fireground activities and fireground responses with good agreement.

AB  - AbstractFirefighters? thermal burden is generally attributed to high heat loads from the fire and metabolic heat generation, which may vary between job assignments and suppression tactic employed. Utilising a full-sized residential structure, firefighters were deployed in six job assignments utilising two attack tactics (1. Water applied from the interior, or 2. Exterior water application before transitioning to the interior). Environmental temperatures decreased after water application, but more rapidly with transitional attack. Local ambient temperatures for inside operation firefighters were higher than other positions (average ~10?30 °C). Rapid elevations in skin temperature were found for all job assignments other than outside command. Neck skin temperatures for inside attack firefighters were ~0.5 °C lower when the transitional tactic was employed. Significantly higher core temperatures were measured for the outside ventilation and overhaul positions than the inside positions (~0.6?0.9 °C). Firefighters working at all fireground positions must be monitored and relieved based on intensity and duration.Practitioner Summary: Testing was done to characterise the thermal burden experienced by firefighters in different job assignments who responded to controlled residential fires (with typical furnishings) using two tactics. Ambient, skin and core temperatures varied based on job assignment and tactic employed, with rapid elevations in core temperature in many roles.

AB  - For decades, research to quantify the effects of firefighting activities and personal protective equipment on physiology and biomechanics has been conducted in a variety of testing environments. It is unknown if these different environments provide similar information and comparable responses. A novel Firefighting Activities Station, which simulates four common fireground tasks, is presented for use with an environmental chamber in a controlled laboratory setting. Nineteen firefighters completed three different exercise protocols following common research practices. Simulated firefighting activities conducted in an environmental chamber or live-fire structures elicited similar physiological responses (max heart rate: 190.1 vs 188.0 bpm, core temperature response: 0.047°C/min vs 0.043°C/min) and accelerometry counts. However, the response to a treadmill protocol commonly used in laboratory settings resulted in significantly lower heart rate (178.4 vs 188.0 bpm), core temperature response (0.037°C/min vs 0.043°C/min) and physical activity counts compared with firefighting activities in the burn building. Practitioner Summary: We introduce a new approach for simulating realistic firefighting activities in a controlled laboratory environment for ergonomics assessment of fire service equipment and personnel. Physiological responses to this proposed protocol more closely replicate those from live-fire activities than a traditional treadmill protocol and are simple to replicate and standardise. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - For firefighters around the world, fire training is necessary to ensure operational readiness, but can be hazardous. Fire instructors routinely attempt to design safe but realistic scenarios and may do so in very different thermal environments. Yet, the physiological burden (and presumed physiological benefits) of different training has rarely been investigated. We studied the impact of three training fire environments: (a) pallets (Pallet), (b) oriented strand board (OSB) and simulated fire/smoke (Fog) on firefighters’ and fire instructors’ physiological responses. Peak ambient temperatures exceeded 420 °C in Pallet and OSB scenarios, but were less than 40 °C for Fog. Firefighters’ peak core temperatures, heart rates and hemostatic responses were not statistically different among the training environments despite the large differences in ambient conditions. Instructors’ heart rate and hemostatic responses were significantly blunted compared to the firefighters’ despite similar peak core temperatures, suggesting instructors performed less work or were less stressed. It is important that physiological responses experienced by firefighters and instructors working in fully encapsulating personal protective equipment be considered based on intensity and duration of work, regardless of the apparent risk from ambient conditions.

AB  - Density is calculated on the basis of the number of people per unit area. In order to properly calculate density, the measurements need to match how the space is actually used. Thus, how people space themselves could be dependent on the nature of the egress component. This study compares different methods of calculating densities for people descending stairs based on the different components (treads and landings or just landings) that are observed. The densities on the different components are not found to be equivalent unless factors (adjusted tread depth and adjusted landing area) are applied. When these factors are applied to a second data set that had a different tread configuration, the densities are again equivalent. When the results are applied to a stair where cultural factors could alter the findings, the adjusted landing area needs to be adjusted in accordance with the expected change in behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Performing fire suppression activities results in cardiovascular stress, hyperthermia, and hypohydration. Fireground rehabilitation (rehab) is recommended to blunt the deleterious effects of these conditions. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that three rehydration fluids provided after exercise while wearing thermal protective clothing (TPC) would produce different heart rate or core temperature responses during a second bout of exercise in TPC. METHODS: On three occasions, 18 euhydrated firefighters (16 men, two women) wearing TPC completed a standardized, 50-minute bout of upper and lower body exercise in a hot room that mimicked the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rehabilitation guidelines of "two cylinders before rehab" (20 minutes of work, 10 minutes of recovery, 20 minutes of work). After an initial bout of exercise (bout 1), subjects were randomly assigned water, sport drink, or an intravenous (IV) infusion of normal saline equal to the amount of body mass lost during exercise. After rehydration, the subject performed a second bout of exercise (bout 2). Heart rates, core and skin temperatures, and exercise durations were compared with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Subjects were firefighters with a mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) age of 28.2 +/- 11.3 years and a mean peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)) of 37.4 +/- 3.4 mL/kg/min. The mean amount of fluid provided during the rehabilitation period was 527 +/- 302 mL. No subject could complete either the pre- or postrehydration 50-minute bout of exercise. The mean (+/-SD) times to exhaustion were longer (p < 0.001) in bout 1 (25.9 +/- 12.9 min, water; 28.0 +/- 14.1 min, sport drink; 27.4 +/- 13.8 min, IV) compared with bout 2 (15.6 +/- 9.6 min, water; 14.7 +/- 8.6 min, sport drink; 15.7 +/- 8.0 min, IV) for all groups but did not differ by intervention. All subjects approached their age-predicted maximum heart rate at the end of bout 1 (180 +/- 11 bpm) and bout 2 (176 +/- 13 bpm). Core temperature rose 1.1 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C during bout 1 and 0.5 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C during bout 2. Core temperatures, heart rates, and exercise times during bout 2 did not differ between the rehydration fluids. CONCLUSIONS: Performances during a second bout of exercise in TPC did not differ when firefighters were rehydrated with water, sport drink, or IV normal saline when full rehydration was provided. Of concern was the inability of all subjects to complete two consecutive periods of heavy exercise in TPC, suggesting that the NFPA's "two cylinders before rehab" guideline may not be appropriate in continuous heavy work scenarios.

AB  - AbstractObjective: Fire suppression is a physically demanding occupation that often results in significant heat stress and hypohydration. Guidelines for the number of work intervals allowed before a structured recovery were consensus derived and have not been tested. Methods: Apparently healthy firefighters were recruited for this field study. Subjects were assigned to two or three bouts of live fire training prior to 20 minutes of structured recovery to provide rehydration and cooling. After recovery, the subjects completed a timed test of firefighting skills. Results: Extending the fire suppression interval from two to three work periods before a structured recovery period increased core temperature and the time required to perform a high intensity circuit of firefighting skills immediately following recovery. A mild hypotension was noted during recovery but the groups did not differ for blood pressure, heart rate, or firefighter perception of thermal strain or exertion. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine the physiologic effects of structural firefighting work intervals on recovery and subsequent performance. Both groups experienced maximal cardiovascular strain during fire suppression but extending the work interval worsened heat stress and negatively affected certain aspects of performance immediately following the recovery period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Firefighters are required to use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), which impairs ventilatory mechanics. We hypothesized that firefighters have elevated arterial CO(2) when using SCBA. METHODS: Firefighters and controls performed a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer and two graded exercise tests (GXTs) at 25%, 50%, and 70% of their maximal aerobic power, once with a SCBA facemask and once with protective clothing and full SCBA. RESULTS: Respiratory rate increased more in controls than firefighters. Heart rate increased as a function of oxygen consumption ( V.O2 ) more in controls than firefighters. End-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) during the GXTs was not affected by work rate in either group for either condition but was higher in firefighters at all work rates in both GXTs. SCBA increased ETCO(2) in controls but not firefighters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that when compared to controls, firefighters' hypoventilate during a maximal test and GXT. The hypoventilation resulted in increased ETCO(2), and presumably increased arterial CO(2), during exertion. It is proposed that firefighters have altered CO(2) sensitivity due to voluntary hypoventilation during training and work. Confirmation of low CO(2) sensitivity and the consequence of this on performance and long-term health remain to be determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thermal protective clothing (TPC) worn by firefighters provides considerable protection from the external environment during structural fire suppression. However, TPC is associated with physiologic derangements that may have adverse cardiovascular consequences. These derangements should be treated during on-scene rehabilitation periods. OBJECTIVE: To examine heart rate and core temperature responses during the application of four active cooling devices, currently being marketed to the fire service for on-scene rehabilitation, and compare them with passive cooling in a moderate temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) and with an infusion of cold (4 degrees C) saline. METHODS: Subjects exercised while they were wearing TPC in a heated room. Following an initial exercise period (bout 1), the subjects exited the room, removed the TPC, and for 20 minutes cooled passively at room temperature, received an infusion of cold normal saline, or were cooled by one of four devices (fan, forearm immersion in water, hand cooling, or water-perfused cooling vest). After cooling, the subjects donned the TPC and entered the heated room for another 50-minute exercise period (bout 2). RESULTS: The subjects were not able to fully recover core temperature during a 20-minute rehabilitation period when provided rehydration and the opportunity to completely remove the TPC. Exercise durations were shorter during bout 2 when compared with bout 1 but did not differ by cooling intervention. The overall magnitudes and rates of cooling and heart rate recovery did not differ by intervention. CONCLUSIONS: No clear advantage was identified when active cooling devices and cold intravenous saline were compared with passive cooling in a moderate temperature after treadmill exercise in TPC.

AB  - Polar volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) such as aldehydes and alcohols are byproducts of normal human metabolism and thus are found in blood and exhaled breath. Perturbation of the normal patterns of such metabolites may reflect exposures to environmental stressors, disease state, and human activity. Presented herein is a specific methodology for assaying PVOC biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples with application to a series of samples from a controlled chamber exposure to dilute diesel exhaust (DE) or to purified air. The collection/analysis method is based on condensation of normal (at rest) exhaled breaths for 10 min (resulting in 1-2 ml of liquid) with subsequent analyte adsorption onto Tenax cartridges followed by thermal desorption and analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Analytical data have linearity of response (R(2)>0.98) across a range of 0-160 ng/ml with a detection limit ranging from 0.2 to 7 ng/ml depending on the compound. Statistical analyses of the results of the controlled exposure study indicate that metabolism, as reflected in simple breath-borne oxygenated species, is not affected by exposure to ambient airborne levels of DE. Linear mixed-effects models showed that PVOC biomarker levels are affected by gender and vary significantly among nominally healthy subjects. Differences among PVOCs analyzed in clinic air, purified chamber air, and chamber air containing dilute DE confirm that most of the compounds are likely of endogenous origin as the exogenous exposure levels did not perturb the EBC measurements.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate alternative designs and liner configurations in fire-fighter protective clothing, or 'turnout gear', to determine the restriction to wearer movement imposed by each. The independent variables were: (1) two alternative sleeve designs (i e, a 'traditional' sleeve design and a prototype sleeve design, featuring additional gusset width and altered armseye position) plus a station uniform worm without any protective clothing and/or equipment; (2) three liner configuration variations (i e, a 'traditional' liner configuration, incorporation of one additional liner, and incorporation of two additional liners); and (3) wearing or not wearing an SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus). The dependent variables for this study were: (1) range of movement in four upper body joints; and (2) a semantic differential scale to evaluate wearers' subjective evaluation of each protective ensemble. Nine male subjects were used. For each of the four joint movements measured (i e, shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder adduction/abduction, shoulder rotation, elbow flexion/extension), a Leighton Flexometer was strapped to the subject at the appropriate body location. The subject was instructed to take the body position indicated. A reading was taken, then the subject was asked to move the body segment to the fullest extent possible in the direction indicated by the researcher. A second reading (representing range of movement) was taken. This procedure was repeated three times for each movement. After the test, subjects were instructed to fill out a semantic differential scale which described their subjective evaluations of the clothing/ equipment configuration. Results showed greater wearer range of movement in the elbow area for the prototype sleeve design over the more traditional sleeve design. Incorporation of additional liners resulted in higher wearer acceptability for the turnout coats than when these liners were not used. As expected, use of an SCBA was extremely restrictive to mobility, and made the protective ensemble less acceptable to wearers.

AB  - Studying the inspiratory recruitment of the scalenes is clinically relevant, but the interpretation of surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings is difficult. The aim of this study was to optimize an averaging method to analyze the surface EMG activity of the scalenes. Ten healthy subjects were studied. Nasal flow and surface EMG of the right scalene were recorded during 15 min epochs of quiet breathing. In four subjects, needle scalene EMG was also recorded. The flow signal was used to trigger the ensemble averaging of the ventilatory wave forms from 80 consecutive breaths. In eight cases, this evidenced a phasic inspiratory activation of the scalenes and permitted the determination of the electromechanical inspiratory delay (134+/-55 ms) and post-inspiratory activity (811+/-233 ms). When simultaneously available, surface and intramuscular recordings provided identical results. An averaging method triggered from a respiratory flow signal can identify and characterize a low phasic inspiratory activity of the scalenes within a noisy surface signal.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The inherent challenges associated with tissue biopsies from lung have spurred an interest in the use of liquid biopsies. Pleural effusions are one source of liquid biopsy. Recently, extracellular vesicles of endocytic origin, exosomes, have attracted interest as liquid biopsy of tumors as they are thought to be a mirror of their tumor of origin. Here, we aimed to analyze if RNA profiling of exosomes isolated from pleural effusions could differentiate patients with lung adenocarcinoma from patients with benign inflammatory processes. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from 36 pleural effusions from patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 18) and patients with benign inflammatory processes (n = 18). The two groups were balanced with respect to age and smoking history but with a gender bias towards males in the benign group. Profiling was conducted using RT-qPCR arrays covering 754 microRNAs and 624 mRNAs followed by statistical ranking of differentially regulated transcripts between the two patient cohorts. RESULTS: RNA profiling revealed differential expression of 17 microRNAs and 71 mRNAs in pleural effusions collected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma compared to pleural effusions from benign lung disease. Overall, top differentially expressed microRNAs, including miR-200 family microRNAs, provided a stronger diagnostic power compared to top differentially expressed mRNAs. However, the mRNA transcript encoding Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) displayed the strongest diagnostic power of all analyzed transcripts (AUC: 0.9916). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that exosomal RNA profiling from pleural effusions can be used to identify patients with lung adenocarcinoma from individuals with benign processes and further proposes miR-200 microRNAs and LCN2 as diagnostic markers in lung cancer liquid biopsies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Neck movement is important for many activities of daily living (ADL). Neck disorders, such as cervical spondylosis and whiplash can limit neck movement and ADL. The cervical range of motion (CROM) device has been recently used to measure neck range of motion (ROM); however, this measurement includes trunk motion, and therefore does not represent a pure neck ROM measurement. The authors aimed to develop a new method to establish pure neck ROM measurements during flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation using a three-dimensional motion analysis system, VICON. METHODS: Twelve healthy participants were recruited and neck ROMs during flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation were measured using VICON and the CROM device. Test-retest repeatability was assessed using interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC). Validity between two measurements was evaluated using a determination coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: ICCs of neck ROM measured using VICON and the CROM device were all at substantial or almost perfect levels [VICON: ICC(1,2) = 0.786-0.962, the CROM device: ICC(1,2) = 0.736-0.950]. Both SEMs and MDCs were low in all measurement directions (VICON: SEM = 1.3 degrees -4.5 degrees , MDC = 3.6 degrees -12.5 degrees ; the CROM device: SEM = 2.2 degrees -3.9 degrees , MDC = 6.1 degrees -10.7 degrees ). Determination coefficients (R(2)s) and Pearson's correlation coefficients (rs) between the two measurement methods were high (R(2) = 0.607-0.745, r = 0.779-0.863). CONCLUSIONS: VICON is a useful system to measure neck ROMs and evaluate the efficacy of interventions, such as surgery or physiotherapeutic exercise.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of human-made compounds with strong C-F bonds, and have been used in various manufacturing industries for decades. PFAS have been reported to deleterious effect on human health, which has led to studies identifying the possible toxicity and toxicity routes of these compounds. We report that these compounds have the potential to cause epigenetic modifications, and to induce dysregulation in the cell proliferation cycle as well as apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells when exposed to 10-, 200- and 400 μM concentrations of each compound. Our studies show that exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may cause hypomethylation in the epigenome, but changes in the epigenetic makeup are not evident upon exposure to GenX. We establish that exposure to lower doses of these compounds causes the cells' balance to shift to cell proliferation, whereas exposure to higher concentrations shifts the balance more towards apoptosis. Furthermore, the apoptosis pathway upon exposure to GenX, PFOA, and PFOS has also been identified. Our findings suggest that exposure to any of these compounds may have profound effects in patients with pre-existing lung conditions or could trigger lung cancinogenesis.

AB  - Obesity and fitness have been identified as key health concerns among USA firefighters yet little is known about the current habits related to exercise and diet. In particular, high-intensity training (HIT) has gained increasing popularity among this population but limited quantitative data are available about how often it is used and the relationship between HIT and other outcomes. Using survey methodology, the current study evaluated self-reported HIT and diet practice among 625 male firefighters. Almost one-third (32.3%) of participants reported engaging in HIT. Body composition, as measured by waist circumference and percentage body fat, was significantly related to HIT training, with HIT participants being approximately half as likely to be classified as obese using body fat [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34-0.78] or waist circumference (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.37-0.98). Those who engaged in HIT were more than twice as likely as those who did not (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.42-3.55) to meet fitness recommendations. Findings highlight directions for future prevention and intervention efforts.

AB  - PURPOSE: Firefighters are expected to respond to any domestic emergency at a moment's notice, and therefore their health and readiness are key to the public safety net. Although emerging research is focusing on understanding firefighters' increased risk for disease and injury, the perspectives of fire service personnel is lacking. DESIGN: This study uses the cross-sectional qualitative data collection techniques of key informant interviews and focus groups. SETTING: Data collection occurred with a national sample of firefighters from 28 (municipal and federal) career fire departments. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 332 career firefighters (57.2%), company officers (23.4%), fire chiefs (15.4%), and other fire service personnel (3.9%). METHOD: Focus groups and informant interviews were conducted with firefighters, fire chiefs, health promotion personnel, and medical directors to assess attitudes, opinions, and perceptions about firefighter health. RESULTS: Major themes that developed among fire service personnel included concerns about cancer, risk of cardiovascular disease, the importance of and barriers to physical fitness, the food culture of the firehouse, psychological stress resulting from repeated exposure to trauma, sleep disruptions, injuries, and risk for infectious disease. Health concerns identified by firefighters are juxtaposed with current efforts and trends within the national fire service. CONCLUSIONS: The health concerns of firefighters parallel both available epidemiological research and the health priorities of national fire service organizations. Unfortunately, these concerns often are in contrast with efforts by local governments to limit their financial liability for illnesses presumed to be caused by occupational exposures and long-held traditions in the fire service. This study highlights the need for epidemiological surveillance of firefighters and innovative health and organizational policy in the fire service. Future directions for the fire service, the public health community, and researchers are discussed.

AB  - The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) created an unprecedented environmental exposure to aerosolized dust, gases and potential carcinogens. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined as the acquisition of somatic mutations in blood cells and is associated with smoking and exposure to genotoxic stimuli. Here we show that deep targeted sequencing of blood samples identified a significantly higher proportion of WTC-exposed first responders with CH (10%; 48 out of 481) when compared with non-WTC-exposed firefighters (6.7%; 17 out of 255; odds ratio, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.64–6.03; P = 0.0006) after controlling for age, sex and race/ethnicity. The frequency of somatic mutations in WTC-exposed first responders showed an age-related increase and predominantly affected DNMT3A, TET2 and other CH-associated genes. Exposure of lymphoblastoid cells to WTC particulate matter led to dysregulation of DNA replication at common fragile sites in vitro. Moreover, mice treated with WTC particulate matter developed an increased burden of mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartments. In summary, the high burden of CH in WTC-exposed first responders provides a rationale for enhanced screening and preventative efforts in this population.

AB  - Objectives: Firefighters have elevated cancer incidence and mortality rates. MicroRNAs play prominent roles in carcinogenesis, but have not been previously evaluated in firefighters. Methods: Blood from 52 incumbent and 45 new recruit nonsmoking firefighters was analyzed for microRNA expression, and the results adjusted for age, obesity, ethnicity, and multiple comparisons. Results: Nine microRNAs were identified with at least a 1.5-fold significant difference between groups. All six microRNAs with decreased expression in incumbent firefighters have been reported to have tumor suppressor activity or are associated with cancer survival, and two of the three microRNAs with increased expression in incumbent firefighters have activities consistent with cancer promotion, with the remaining microRNA associated with neurological disease. Conclusion: Incumbent firefighters showed differential microRNA expression compared with new recruits, providing potential mechanisms for increased cancer risk in firefighters.

AB  - To take into account reasonably the safety requirements of the disabled on emergency evacuation in the design, usage, management and emergency response of public places, the authors of this paper organized on-site experiments for 100 disabled individuals (40 people with no supporting tools, 20 people using a single crutch and 40 people two crutches) and 17 healthy people at a subway station in Beijing. The experiments were designed to measure the unimpeded free walking speed of the participants during horizontal and stair ascending/descending movement, and to assess the possible impact of passage width on movement speed. Based on the results of the tests, the authors systematically analyzed the speed variation patterns with disability grade, gender and passage width. The validity of the value of an important parameter for evacuation safety design in the prescribed fire codes in mainland China, the width of a single stream of people, is assessed. Finally the results of the experiments are compared with that from other researches to identify the similarities and differences between them.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether lower extremity fatigue affects the ability of an individual to balance on an unstable platform. METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects (average age, 29 yr, range, 20 to 39 yr) were tested on an instrumented balance assessment system. Static tests were done on the limbs unilaterally and then bilaterally, and finally a dynamic test was performed in which the subject moved the platform in a circular manner to chase a moving object on a computer screen. After testing, subjects were fatigued using an isokinetic dynamometer, which imposes closed kinetic chain antagonistic exercise on the ankle, knee, and hip, similar to a stair stepper. No rest was allowed, and subjects were fatigued to less than 50% of their initial tested force. Subjects were then immediately retested on the unstable platform using the same testing protocol. All subjects completed the testing. RESULTS: Analysis of pre- and post-fatigue balance results demonstrated significant decreases in motor control performance on the three static tests following exercise to fatigue in all subjects (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support anecdotal evidence that fatigued individuals are at increased risk of injury because of loss of balance. Avoidance of fatigue and preconditioning may prevent injury.

AB  - Musculoskeletal neck discomfort is prevalent in many occupations and has been the focus of much research employing surface electromyography (sEMG). Significant differences in experimental methods among researchers make comparisons across studies difficult. The goal of the current research was to use empirical methods to answer specific methodological questions concerning use of sEMG in evaluation of the neck extensor system. This was accomplished in two studies. In Experiment 1, ultrasound technology was used to: (a) determine accessibility of m. splenius and semispinalis capitis with surface electrodes, (b) identify appropriate electrode locations for these muscles/muscle groups, and (c) illustrate potential benefits of using ultrasound in locating muscles/placing electrodes. Experiment 2 sought to assess effects of posture when normalizing sEMG data. Results from Experiment 1 showed no direct access to semispinalis capitis for surface electrodes; their activity can only be sampled as part of a group of muscles. In most subjects, m. splenius was found to be accessible to surface electrodes. Electrode placement recommendations are provided. Results of Experiment 2 showed significant differences in normalized EMG data between a posture-specific technique and a reference posture technique. Posture-specific normalization is recommended for accurately assessing the relative intensity of contractions of these muscles.

AB  - Soot contains high levels of toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Extraction of PAHs from soot for quantitative analysis is difficult because the compounds are extremely tightly bound to the sorbent matrix. This study was designed to investigate the effect of solvent type on PAH extraction yield, to identify the most optimal solvent for PAH extraction from soot, and to gain insight into the mechanism of PAH sorption to soot in aquatic environments. To that end, different types of soot as well as coal, charcoal, and sediments containing soot-like material were extracted with seven organic solvents. Large differences in extraction recoveries were observed among solvents, with relative values as low as 16% as compared to the best extracting solvent. These differences were much larger for soot than for sediments. Dichloromethane, which to date is the most widely used solvent for soot and sediment extractions, appeared to be the overall worst extractant, whereas toluene/methanol (1:6) gave the best results. Based on extraction yields and solvent properties, extraction of PAHs from soot was explained by a two-step mechanism involving swelling of the sorbent matrix and subsequent displacement of sorbates by solvent molecules. Due to the low displacement capacity of water, desorption of PAHs from soot in the aquatic environment will be strongly limited. Moreover, a certain fraction of the total PAH mass on soot is suggested to be physically entrapped, making it unavailable for partitioning to the aqueous phase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression could provide a mechanism linking firefighter exposure to increased cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine if changes in longitudinal miRNA expression in firefighters are associated with occupational exposures. METHODS: Whole blood MiRNA was evaluated in 52 new recruits prior to live-fire training and 20-37 months later. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, ethnicity, BMI, and batch effects were used to determine associations separately for all fires and structure fires only between employment duration, cumulative fire-hours and fire-runs, and time since most recent fire with (1) nine a priori and (2) the full array of 799 miRNAs. RESULTS: For multivariable models including all fires, two a priori miRNAs were associated with employment duration and four with time since most recent fire. For multivariable models restricted to structure fires, three a priori miRNAs were associated with employment duration and one with fire-runs. Additional miRNAs from the full array were associated with employment duration for all fires and/or structure fires. In general, tumor suppressive miRNAs decreased and oncogenic miRNAs increased with exposure. SIGNIFICANCE: Changes in miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of exposure effects and a mechanism for increased cancer risk in firefighters.

AB  - Unaccustomed strenuous physical exertion in hot environments can result in heat stroke and acute kidney injury (AKI). Both exercise-induced muscle damage and AKI are associated with the release of interleukin-6, but whether muscle damage causes AKI in the heat is unknown. We hypothesized that muscle-damaging exercise, before exercise in the heat, would increase kidney stress. Ten healthy euhydrated men underwent a randomized, crossover trial involving both a 60-min downhill muscle-damaging run (exercise-induced muscle damage; EIMD), and an exercise intensity-matched non-muscle-damaging flat run (CON), in random order separated by 2 wk. Both treatments were followed by heat stress elicited by a 40-min run at 33°C. Urine and blood were sampled at baseline, after treatment, and after subjects ran in the heat. By design, EIMD induced higher plasma creatine kinase and interleukin-6 than CON. EIMD elevated kidney injury biomarkers (e.g., urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) after a run in the heat: EIMD-CON, mean difference [95% CI]: 12 [5, 19] ng/ml) and reduced kidney function (e.g., plasma creatinine after a run in the heat: EIMD-CON, mean difference [95% CI]: 0.2 [0.1, 0.3] mg/dl), where CI is the confidence interval. Plasma interleukin-6 was positively correlated with plasma NGAL (r = 0.9, P = 0.001). Moreover, following EIMD, 5 of 10 participants met AKIN criteria for AKI. Thus for the first time we demonstrate that muscle-damaging exercise before running in the heat results in a greater inflammatory state and kidney stress compared with non-muscle-damaging exercise. Muscle damage should therefore be considered a risk factor for AKI when performing exercise in hot environments.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the role of obesity on the association between sleep and on-duty injury among male career firefighters. Methods: Data on 1,419 male career firefighters for this cross-sectional study came from two firefighter cohorts from 2008–2013. On-duty injury within the past 6–12 months was the dependent variable and getting enough sleep was the independent variable. A multivariable, mixed effect logistic regression model stratified by BMI categories was created to examine the presence of effect measure modification. Results: Only obese firefighter who did not get enough sleep were twice as likely to have an on-duty injury than those who got enough sleep. This association was not significant among normal or overweight firefighters. Conclusions: Future studies into on-duty injury and sleep should examine body composition as an effect modifier among career firefighters. Address correspondence to: Christopher M.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart disease causes 45% of the deaths that occur among U.S. firefighters while they are on duty. We examined duty-specific risks of death from coronary heart disease among on-duty U.S. firefighters from 1994 to 2004. METHODS: We reviewed summaries provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the deaths of all on-duty firefighters between 1994 and 2004, except for deaths associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Estimates of the proportions of time spent by firefighters each year performing various duties were obtained from a municipal fire department, from 17 large metropolitan fire departments, and from a national database. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death from coronary heart disease during specific duties were calculated from the ratios of the observed odds to the expected odds, with nonemergency duties as the reference category. RESULTS: Deaths from coronary heart disease were associated with suppressing a fire (32.1% of all such deaths), responding to an alarm (13.4%), returning from an alarm (17.4%), engaging in physical training (12.5%), responding to nonfire emergencies (9.4%), and performing nonemergency duties (15.4%). As compared with the odds of death from coronary heart disease during nonemergency duties, the odds were 12.1 to 136 times as high during fire suppression, 2.8 to 14.1 times as high during alarm response, 2.2 to 10.5 times as high during alarm return, and 2.9 to 6.6 times as high during physical training. These odds were based on three estimates of the time that firefighters spend on their duties. CONCLUSIONS: Certain emergency firefighting duties were associated with a risk of death from coronary heart disease that was markedly higher than the risk associated with nonemergency duties. Fire suppression was associated with the highest risk, which was approximately 10 to 100 times as high as that for nonemergency duties.

AB  - The importance of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is well established. This report provides newly developed standards for CRF reference values derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) using cycle ergometry in the United States. Ten laboratories in the United States experienced in CPX administration with established quality control procedures contributed to the “Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Database” (FRIEND) Registry from April 2014 through May 2016. Data from 4494 maximal (respiratory exchange ratio, ≥1.1) cycle ergometer tests from men and women (20-79 years) from 27 states, without cardiovascular disease, were used to develop these references values. Percentiles of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) for men and women were determined for each decade from age 20 years through age 79 years. Comparisons of VO2max were made to reference data established with CPX data from treadmill data in the FRIEND Registry and previously published reports. As expected, there were significant differences between sex and age groups for VO2max (P<.01). For cycle tests within the FRIEND Registry, the 50th percentile VO2max of men and women aged 20 to 29 years declined from 41.9 and 31.0 mLO2/kg/min to 19.5 and 14.8 mLO2/kg/min for ages 70 to 79 years, respectively. The rate of decline in this cohort was approximately 10% per decade. The FRIEND Registry reference data will be useful in providing more accurate interpretations for the US population of CPX-measured VO2max from exercise tests using cycle ergometry compared with previous approaches based on estimations of standard differences from treadmill testing reference values.

AB  - Based on the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on reduction of blood viscosity, we theorized that PUFA could improve aerobic performance by increasing oxygen supply to tissues. Twenty male subjects were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10): a fish oil group (FG) and a control (CG). Maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen uptake during submaximal exercise were measured using a cycle ergometer. For 8 weeks, the FG then ingested capsules containing 3.6 g/day of EPA-rich fish oil, while the CG took 3.6 g/day of a medium-chain triglyceride. After supplementation, erythrocyte EPA and DHA in the FG were significantly increased. In the FG, a negative linear correlation was detected in the change between erythrocyte EPA and whole oxygen uptake during submaximal exercise pre- and post-supplementation. The present study showed that EPA-rich fish oil supplementation improves exercise economy in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare reduction of type III distal phalangeal fractures using 4.5 and 5.5 mm cortical screws placed in lag fashion and an intact hoof capsule model. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric experimental study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Hooves from 12 adult horses (n=24). METHODS: Sagittal fractures were created in pairs of distal phalanges after distal interphalangeal joint disarticulation and were reduced with either 4.5 or 5.5 mm cortical screws placed in lag fashion. Contralateral phalanges served as non-reduced controls. Fracture reduction following screw placement was assessed by comparing pre-reduction and post-reduction fracture gap measurements from radiographs using paired t-tests. Effects of incremental loading (0, 135, 270, 540, 800, 1070, and 1335 kg) on fracture gaps in 6 phalanges reduced with 4.5 mm screws and 5 phalanges reduced with 5.5 mm screws were measured from fluoroscopic images and assessed by 2-way ANOVA. Significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: Type III distal phalanx fractures were reliably created. Only 5.5 mm cortical screws, not 4.5 mm screws, significantly reduced fracture gaps and constrained fracture gap expansion 3 cm distal to the articular surface. Compressive loading closed the fracture gaps at the articular surface in both non-reduced control groups and those reduced with either 5.5 or 4.5 mm screws. CONCLUSION: The 5.5 mm cortical screws were more effective than 4.5 mm screws in reducing type III distal phalanx fractures and restricting distal fracture gap expansion under load.

AB  - Occupational exposures to combustion emissions were examined in Ottawa Fire Service (OFS) firefighters. Paired urine and dermal wipe samples (i.e., pre- and post-event) as well as personal air samples and fire event questionnaires were collected from 27 male OFS firefighters. A total of 18 OFS office workers were used as additional controls. Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other organic mutagens were assessed by quantification of urinary PAH metabolite levels, levels of PAHs in dermal wipes and personal air samples, and urinary mutagenicity using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay (Ames test). Urinary Clara Cell 16 (CC16) and 15-isoprostane F(2t) (8-iso-PGF(2α)) levels were used to assess lung injury and overall oxidative stress, respectively. The results showed significant 2.9- to 5.3-fold increases in average post-event levels of urinary PAH metabolites, depending on the PAH metabolite (p < 0.0001). Average post-event levels of urinary mutagenicity showed a significant, event-related 4.3-fold increase (p < 0.0001). Urinary CC16 and 8-iso-PGF(2α) did not increase. PAH concentrations in personal air and on skin accounted for 54% of the variation in fold changes of urinary PAH metabolites (p < 0.002). The results indicate that emergency, on-shift fire suppression is associated with significantly elevated exposures to combustion emissions.

AB  - This study examined occupational exposures of Ottawa firefighters to combustion by-products and selected metals. We measured exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), antimony, cadmium, and lead using (1) personal air samplers worn by firefighters during emergency fire suppression; (2) wipe samples from skin, personal clothing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) collected before and after emergency firefighting (n=29); and (3) air samples collected in three fire stations vehicle bays, truck cabs, and one administration office. We assessed OFS PPE decontamination procedures using wipe samples collected before and after laundering (n=12). Air concentrations exceeded occupational exposure limits at two fire events for lead and nine for PAHs. After fire suppression, PAH concentrations were significantly higher on skin and PPE (p<0.001), skin, clothing, and PPE for antimony (p<0.001, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively), and skin and PPE for lead (p<0.001). Air concentrations of PAHs and antimony were significantly higher in vehicle bays compared to the office (p<0.05), but significantly lower compared to fire truck cabs (p<0.05). Washing PPE was effective in removing, on average, 61% of PAHs, 55% of antimony, 97% of lead, and 90% of cadmium. These results indicate that firefighters are significantly exposed, via multiple routes, to combustion by-products during on-shift fire suppression.

AB  - [Stressful life experience can have significant effects on a variety of physiological systems, including the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system. These relationships can be bidirectional; for example, immune cell products can act on the brain, altering mood and cognition, potentially contributing to depression. Although acute physiological alterations may be adaptive in the short term, chronic or repeated provocation can result in damage to health. The central dogma in the field of stress research assumes a stereotyped physiological response to all stressors (the generality model). However, increasing evidence suggests that specific stressful conditions and the specific way an organism appraises these conditions can elicit qualitatively distinct emotional and physiological responses (the integrated specificity model). For example, appraisals of threat (vs. challenge), uncontrollability, and negative social evaluation have been shown to provoke specific psychobiological responses. Emotional responses appear to have specific neural substrates, which can result in differentiated alterations in peripheral physiological systems, so that it is incorrect to presume a uniform stress response.]

AB  - This paper describes experimental investigations on fire service ventilation practices in modern house geometries. Two houses were constructed inside a large fire facility. The first of two houses constructed was a one-story, 111.5 m2, 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom house with 8 total rooms. The second house was a two-story 297.3 m2, 4 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom house with 12 total rooms. The second house featured a modern open floor plan, two-story great room and open foyer. Fifteen experiments were conducted varying the ventilation locations and the number of ventilation openings. Ventilation scenarios included ventilating the front door only, opening the front door and a window near and remote from the seat of the fire, opening a window only and ventilating a higher opening in the two-story house. One scenario in each house was conducted in triplicate to examine repeatability. The results of these experiments examine potential occupant tenability and provide knowledge for the fire service for them to examine their horizontal ventilation standard operating procedures and training content. The fire dynamics resulting from ventilation practices such as ventilation near or remote from the seat of the fire and high versus low in relation to the fire are examined. Several other tactical considerations were developed utilizing the data from these experiments to provide specific examples of changes that can be adopted based on a departments current strategies and tactics. Such tactical considerations and a systems approach to fire service tactics should be investigated further.

AB  - This study examines the impact of firefighting intervention on occupant tenability to provide actionable guidance for selecting firefighting tactics that are based upon empirical rather than anecdotal evidence. Twelve fire experiments were conducted utilizing a full-sized residential structure to assess the impact of firefighting tactics on occupant exposure. Six groups of firefighters, recruited from fire departments throughout the country, participated in two experiments each. Two attack tactics were examined: (1) interior attack—water applied from the interior while a search team searched for simulated trapped occupants, and (2) transitional attack—exterior water application before transitioning to the interior while a search team searched for simulated trapped occupants. Gas concentration and temperature measurements were analyzed using a fractional effective dose (FED) approach to determine the impact of firefighter tactics on the exposure for potential trapped occupants. Water application by the fire attack teams resulted in a rapid drop in temperatures throughout the structure, followed shortly afterward by a decrease in the FED rate. There was no significant difference between the magnitude of the temperature decrease or the time until the inflection point in the FED curve between transitional attack and interior attack. As the removal time for the occupant increased, the toxic exposure to the occupant increased, despite the decreasing FED rate due to suppression. Occupant tenability analysis showed that the most threatened occupants are not always closest to the seat of the fire, while occupants near the fire but behind closed doors may have received a low exposure. As such, the results emphasized the need for rapid removal of occupants and coordination of suppression and ventilation tactics to limit toxic exposures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is representative of daily-life activities and reflects the functional capacity of patients. The change of oxygen uptake (VO2) in the initial phase of low-intensity exercise (VO2 kinetics) can be used to assess submaximal exercise performance of patients.The objective of the following study was to analyse VO2 kinetics in patients with different pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we investigated the extent to which VO2 kinetics at the onset of the 6MWT were associated with exercise capacity, morbidity and mortality. METHODS: VO2 kinetics of 204 patients and 16 healthy controls were obtained using mobile telemetric cardiopulmonary monitoring during a 6MWT. A new mean response time (MRT) index (wMRT) was developed to quantify VO2 kinetics by correcting MRT for work rate. The differences in wMRT between disease categories as well as the association between wMRT and patients' exercise capacity and outcome - time to hospitalization/death- were tested. RESULTS: The assessment of a robust wMRT was feasible in 86% (244/284) patients. wMRT was increased in patients compared to healthy controls (p <0.001). wMRT was largest in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There were significant associations between wMRT and exercise capacity in all patients. High wMRT was found to be associated with a high rate of death and re-hospitalization in patients with CHF (p = 0.024). In patients with pulmonary diseases and pulmonary hypertension wMRT was not associated with outcome (p = 0.952). CONCLUSIONS: Submaximal exercise performance of patients is reduced. O2 kinetics at the onset of exercise are associated with exercise capacity in all patients. wMRT was found to be an important prognostic factor in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), but not with pulmonary diseases.

AB  - Risk of slips, trips, and falls in firefighters may be influenced by the firefighter's equipment and duration of firefighting. This study examined the impact of a four self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) -three SCBA of increasing size and a prototype design- and three work cycles -one bout (1B), two bouts with a five-minute break (2B), and two bouts back-to-back (BB)- on gait in 30 firefighters. Five gait parameters (double support time, single support time, stride length, step width, and stride velocity) were examined pre- and post-firefighting activity. The two largest SCBA resulted in longer double support times relative to the smallest SCBA. Multiple bouts of firefighting activity resulted in increased single and double support time and decreased stride length, step width, and stride velocity. These results suggest that with larger SCBA or longer durations of activity, firefighters may adopt more conservative gait patterns to minimize fall risk. Practitioner Summary The effects of four self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and three work cycles on five gait parameters were examined pre- and post-firefighting activity. Both SCBA size and work cycle affected gait. The two largest SCBA resulted in longer double support times. Multiple bouts of activity resulted in more conservative gait patterns.

AB  - Slips, trips and falls are leading causes of fireground injuries. A functional balance test (FBT) was used to investigate the effects of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) size and design, plus firefighting work cycle. During the FBT, subjects walked along a narrow platform and turned in defined spaces, with and without an overhead obstacle. Thirty firefighters wore three varying-sized standard SCBAs and a low-profile prototype SCBA during three simulated firefighting work/rest cycles. Firefighters were tested pre- and post-firefighting activity (one bout, two bouts with a 5-min break, or back-to-back bouts with no break). Subjects committed more errors and required longer completion times with larger SCBAs. Use of the prototype SCBA lead to lower times and fewer errors. Performing a second bout of firefighting increased completion time. Firefighters need to consider how SCBA and amount of physical activity on the fireground may influence balance in order to reduce the risk of injury. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - AbstractFirefighters? self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) protects the respiratory system during firefighting but increases the physiological burden. Extended duration SCBA (>30 min) have increased air supply, potentially increasing the duration of firefighting work cycles. To examine the effects of SCBA configuration and work cycle (length and rest), 30 firefighters completed seven trials using different SCBA and one or two bouts of simulated firefighting following work cycles common in the United States. Heart rate, core temperature, oxygen consumption, work output and self-reported perceptions were recorded during all activities. Varying SCBA resulted in few differences in these parameters. However, during a second bout, work output significantly declined while heart rates and core temperatures were elevated relative to a single bout. Thirty seven per cent of the subjects were unable to complete the second bout in at least one of the two-bout conditions. These firefighters had lower fitness and higher body mass than those who completed all assigned tasks.Practitioner Summary: The effects of extended duration SCBA and work/rest cycles on physiological parameters and work output have not been examined. Cylinder size had minimal effects, but extended work cycles with no rest resulted in increased physiological strain and decreased work output. This effect was more pronounced in firefighters with lower fitness.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Slips, trips, and falls are a leading cause of injury to firefighters with many injuries occurring while traversing stairs, possibly exaggerated by acute fatigue from firefighting activities and/or asymmetric load carriage. This study examined the effects that fatigue, induced by simulated firefighting activities, and hose load carriage have on foot clearance while traversing stairs. Landing and passing foot clearances for each stair during ascent and descent of a short staircase were investigated. Clearances decreased significantly (. p < 0.05) post-exercise for nine of 12 ascent parameters and increased for two of eight descent parameters. Load carriage resulted in significantly decreased (. p < 0.05) clearance over three ascent parameters, and one increase during descent. Decreased clearances during ascent caused by fatigue or load carriage may result in an increased trip risk. Increased clearances during descent may suggest use of a compensation strategy to ensure stair clearance or an increased risk of over-stepping during descent. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - To better assess the energy expenditure and exertion of firefighters during simulated firefighting activities, a commercial firefighter self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) facepiece was modified to interface with a portable metabolic monitoring device (Cosmed K4b2) while still functioning as a positive pressure SCBA air supply. To validate the device, standard National Fire Protection Association 1981 SCBA function tests were conducted and 14 subjects performed variable-workload assessments using all combinations of two test devices (Cosmed K4b2 and metabolic cart) and two masks (modified SCBA facepiece and stock manufacturer-supplied breath collection). Metabolic data collected with the Cosmed K4b2 via the modified facepiece were found to be accurate when compared to a ParvoMedics Truemax 2400 metabolic cart (average per cent difference: 4.6%). This modified facepiece design is suitable for use in metabolic studies requiring the utilisation of an SCBA system. Furthermore, the well-established overestimation of oxygen consumption from the Cosmed K4b2 system was replicated. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Expedited evacuation of commercial and residential structures in the event of an emergency may be more difficult for persons with physical movement disorders. There is a need to better characterize the impact of such disorders and provide movement data to improve evacuee and responder safety. We undertook a pilot, feasibility study that investigated the ability of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and controls without MS to walk along a 48 m long path that included five different door configurations with various opening hardware and closure mechanisms, both before and after a six-minute walk, simulating a long evacuation path. Persons with MS took longer to complete the evacuation circuit (102 vs. 31 s) and to pass through each door (average 4.8 vs. 1.4 s) compared to controls. During the six-minute walk, persons with MS had decreased walking speed (0.7 vs. 1.9 m/s). The MS population demonstrated more conservative gait biomechanics throughout the simulation, i.e., wider, shorter and slower steps. Timing and biomechanical differences between populations and the potential fatigue induced through an extended evacuation can be used to improve understanding of movement in populations with disabilities, and incorporate these data into estimation of flow rates during evacuation.

AB  - AbstractFirefighter hoods must provide protection from elevated temperatures and products of combustion (e.g. particulate) while simultaneously being wearable (comfortable and not interfering with firefighting activities). The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of (1) hood design (traditional knit hood vs particulate-blocking hood), (2) repeated laundering, and (3) hood removal method (traditional vs overhead doffing) on (a) protection from soot contamination on the neck, (b) heat stress and (c) wearability measures. Using a fireground exposure simulator, 24 firefighters performed firefighting activities in realistic smoke and heat conditions using a new knit hood, new particulate-blocking hood and laundered particulate-blocking hood. Overall, soot contamination levels measured from neck skin were lower when wearing the laundered particulate-blocking hoods compared to new knit hoods, and when using the overhead hood removal process. No significant differences in skin temperature, core temperature, heart rate or wearability measures were found between the hood conditions. Practitioner Summary: The addition of a particulate-blocking layer to firefighters? traditional two-ply hood was found to reduce the PAH contamination reaching the neck but did not affect heat stress measurements or thermal perceptions. Modifying the process for hood removal resulted in a larger reduction in neck skin contamination than design modification.

AB  - This study investigated the use of postural sway measurements as a potential safety monitoring technique. Sixteen healthy male volunteers (age: 41.8+/-9.3 years) participated in this study. The level of neurophysiological strain and the ability to maintain upright balance for workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) were investigated. Three levels of PPE, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-defined levels A, B, and C, were worn in random order while performing two randomly ordered tasks, resting and a workload. After the workload task, the perceived exertion and discomfort were recorded. Postural sway, measured using a microprocessor-based force platform system, was assessed after each task. The variables of sway area and sway length were calculated from stabilograms. These measurements were taken for three sway tests: 1) Eyes open (EO), 2) Eyes closed on a four-inch foam (FC), and 3) a dynamic test with the subject reaching for a weight placed in front, lifting it to his or her chest, and lowering back to the shelf four times (RE). The heart rate was significantly higher for the workload task (p < 0.05), and the levels A and B PPE demonstrated significantly higher perceived exertion results than level C PPE (p < 0.05). The heart rate and perceived exertion were not significantly correlated with the sway measurements. Level A produced significant self-reported discomfort results for the upper back, lower back, and thighs. The sway variables showed significant differences with the PPE levels and the task. The workload task produced significantly higher sway length than the resting task (p < 0.05) for all test conditions. The PPE level B produced significantly higher sway length than PPE level A (p < 0.05) in the FC test condition. These results indicate that postural stability is altered with PPE use and with fatigued postural muscles. In summary, postural sway measurements may be used as a potential safety monitoring technique.

AB  - Firefighters may be exposed to toxic combustion products not only during fire fighting operations and training, but also afterwards as a result of contact with contaminated structural fire fighting ensembles. This study characterized the deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) onto structural fire fighting ensembles and off-gassing of combustion products from ensembles after multiple exposures to hostile structural attack fire environments. A variety of PAHs were deposited onto the outer layer of structural fire fighting ensembles, with no variation in deposition flux between new ensembles and already contaminated ensembles. Contaminants released from ensembles after use included volatile organic compounds, carbonyl compounds, low molecular weight PAHs, and hydrogen cyanide. Air samples collected in a similar manner after laundering of ensembles according to manufacturer specifications indicated that laundering returns off-gassing concentrations of most of the investigated compounds to pre-exposure levels. These findings suggest that contamination of firefighter protective clothing increases with use, and that storage of unlaundered structural fire fighting ensembles in small, unventilated spaces immediately after use may create a source of future exposure to toxic combustion products for fire fighting personnel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A leading contributing factor to firefighter injury and death is lack of fitness. Therefore, the Fire Service Joint Labor Management Wellness-Fitness Initiative (WFI) was established that includes a focus on providing fitness assessments to all fire service personnel. The current fitness assessment includes a submaximal exercise test protocol and associated prediction equation to predict individual VO(2peak) as a measure of fitness. There is limited information on the accuracy, precision, and sources of error of this prediction equation. This study replicated previous research by validating the accuracy of the WFI VO(2peak) prediction equation for a group of firefighters and further examining potential sources of error for an individual firefighters’ assessment. METHODS: The sample consisted of 22 firefighters who completed a maximal exercise test protocol similar to the WFI submaximal protocol, but the test was terminated when firefighters reached a maximal level of exertion (i.e., measured VO(2peak)). We then calculated the predicted VO(2peak) based on the WFI prediction equation along with individual firefighters’ body mass index (BMI) and 85% of maximum heart rate. The data were analyzed using paired samples t-tests in SPSS v. 21.0. RESULTS: The difference between predicted and measured VO(2peak) was -0.77 ± 8.35 mL•kg(-1)•min(-1). However, there was a weak, statistically non-significant association between measured VO(2peak) and predicted VO(2peak) (R(2) = 0.09, F(1,21) = 2.05, p = 0.17). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.215, p > 0.05) and Pearson (r = 0.31, p = 0.17) and Spearman (ρ = 0.28, p = 0.21) correlation coefficients were small. The standard error of the estimate (SEE) was 8.5 mL•kg(-1)•min(-1). Further, both age and baseline fitness level were associated with increased inaccuracy of the prediction equation. CONCLUSIONS: We provide data on the inaccuracy and sources of error for the WFI VO(2peak) prediction equation for predicting fitness level in individual firefighters, despite apparently accurate predictions for a group of firefighters. These results suggest that the WFI prediction equation may need to be reevaluated as a means of precisely determining fitness for individual firefighters, which may affect employment status, duty assignment, and overall life safety of the firefighter.

AB  - Detox diets are popular dieting strategies that claim to facilitate toxin elimination and weight loss, thereby promoting health and well-being. The present review examines whether detox diets are necessary, what they involve, whether they are effective and whether they present any dangers. Although the detox industry is booming, there is very little clinical evidence to support the use of these diets. A handful of clinical studies have shown that commercial detox diets enhance liver detoxification and eliminate persistent organic pollutants from the body, although these studies are hampered by flawed methodologies and small sample sizes. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that certain foods such as coriander, nori and olestra have detoxification properties, although the majority of these studies have been performed in animals. To the best of our knowledge, no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of commercial detox diets in humans. This is an area that deserves attention so that consumers can be informed of the potential benefits and risks of detox programmes.

AB  - This paper reviews the biomedical aspects of transporting loads in packs and offers suggestions for improving load-carriage capability. Locating the load mass as close as possible to the body center of gravity appears to result in the lowest energy cost when carrying a pack. Thus, the double pack (half the load on the front of the body and half the load on the back) has a lower energy cost than the backpack. However, backpacks provide greater versatility in most situations. The energy cost of walking with backpack loads increases progressively with increases in load mass, body mass, walking speed or grade; type of terrain also influences energy cost. Predictive equations have been developed for estimating the energy cost of carrying loads during locomotion but these may not be accurate for prolonged (>2 h) or downhill carriage. Training with loads can result in greater energy efficiency since walking with backpack loads over several weeks decreases energy cost. Load-carriage speed can be increased with physical training that involves regular running and resistance training. Erector spinae electrical activity (EMG) is lower during load carriage than in unloaded walking until loads exceed 30-40 kg, at which point erector spinae EMG activity is higher than during unloaded walking. EMGs of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius, but not the tibialis anterior or hamstrings, increase with load. Framed packs with hip belts reduce the electrical activity of the trapezius muscles, presumably by shifting forces from the shoulders to the hips. Increases in the backpack load mass result in increases in forces exerted on the grounds, amount of knee flexion and the forward inclination of the trunk. Compared to backpacks, double packs produce fewer deviations from normal walking. Common injuries associated with prolonged load carriage include foot blisters, stress fractures, back strains, metatarsalgia (foot pain), rucksack palsy (shoulder traction injury) and knee pain. Closed-cell neoprene insoles and use of an acrylic or nylon sock, combined with a wool sock, reduce blister incidence. A framed pack with a hip belt reduces the incidence of rucksack palsy. Backpack load carriage can be facilitated by lightening loads, optimizing equipment, improving load distribution and by preventive action aimed at reducing the incidence of injury.

AB  - This study reviews historical and biomedical aspects of soldier load carriage. Before the 18th century, foot soldiers seldom carried more than 15 kg while on the march, but loads have progressively risen since then. This load increase is presumably due to the weight of weapons and equipment that incorporate new technologies to increase protection, firepower, communications, and mobility. Research shows that locating the load center of mass as close as possible to the body center of mass results in the lowest energy cost and tends to keep the body in an upright position similar to unloaded walking. Loads carried on other parts of the body result in higher energy expenditures: each kilogram added to the foot increases energy expenditure 7% to 10%; each kilogram added to the thigh increases energy expenditure 4%. Hip belts on rucksacks should be used whenever possible as they reduce pressure on the shoulders and increase comfort. Low or mid-back load placement might be preferable on uneven terrain but high load placement may be best for even terrain. In some tactical situations, combat load carts can be used, and these can considerably reduce energy expenditure and improve performance. Physical training that includes aerobic exercise, resistance training targeted at specific muscle groups, and regular road marching can considerably improve road marching speed and efficiency. The energy cost of walking with backpack loads increases progressively with increases in weight carried, body mass, walking speed, or grade; type of terrain also influences energy cost. Predictive equations have been developed, but these may not be accurate for prolonged load carriage. Common injuries associated with prolonged load carriage include foot blisters, stress fractures, back strains, metatarsalgia, rucksack palsy, and knee pain. Load carriage can be facilitated by lightening loads, improving load distribution, optimizing load-carriage equipment, and taking preventive action to reduce the incidence of injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing use of helmet-mounted displays in aviation raises issues of head-supported weight and neck musculoskeletal function, especially during acceleration. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify musculoskeletal stress as weight was added to the front of the head in different head positions and determine the effectiveness of a counterbalance in reducing stress. METHODS: There were 20 subjects who participated. The study required that the subject move his head every 10 s for 10 min to one of five positions that were assumed to represent those readily adopted in everyday situations: neutral, 30 degrees extended, 30 degrees flexed, 35 degrees left rotated, and 35 degrees right rotated. Of the subjects, 10 repeated the test while wearing a GSMK6 helmet, and when 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, or 2.0 kg was added to the front of the helmet. The other 10 subjects repeated the test but with counterbalances. During testing, EMG was recorded from the neck extensors and sternocleidomastoid muscle. Pain levels were recorded using the Borg-CR10 scale. RESULTS: Changes in head position from neutral resulted in significant increases of EMG amplitude (mean +/- SD) in the neck extensors of up to 18 +/- 13% (p < 0.05), and due to head load by 46 +/- 33% (p < 0.05) with a frontal load of 2 kg. Sternocleidomastoid EMG showed little change due to increases in load but increased significantly by up to 265 +/- 227% of the neutral position (p < 0.05) when the head was rotated. CONCLUSIONS: The use of head-mounted displays presents the risk of detrimental effects to the musculoskeletal system. Determining the effect of added weight requires a knowledge of working head postures.

AB  - Resistance exercise can result in localized damage to muscle tissue. This damage may be observed in sarcolemma, basal lamina, as well as, in the contractile elements and the cytoskeleton. Usually the damage is accompanied by release of enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and other proteins into the blood. Serum CK has been proposed as one of the best indirect indicators of muscle damage due to its ease of identification and the relatively low cost of assays to quantify it. Thus, CK has been used as an indicator of the training intensity and a diagnostic marker of overtraining. However, some issues complicate CK's use in this manner. There is great interindividual variability in serum CK, which complicates the assignment of reliable reference values for athletes. Furthermore, factors such as training level, muscle groups involved, and gender can influence CK levels to a greater extent than differences in exercise volume completed. This review will detail the process by which resistance exercise induces a rise in circulating CK, illuminate the various factors that affect the CK response to resistance exercise, and discuss the relative usefulness of CK as a marker of training status, in light of these factors.

AB  - This study compared the gait characteristics of individuals walking in heat while wearing firefighting equipment in fatigued and non-fatigued states. Nineteen subjects performed a 50-min treadmill protocol in a heated room while gait patterns were recorded using a digital video camcorder. Forty gait cycles were analyzed near the beginning (9 min) and at the end (39–49 min) of exercise. Spatio-temporal gait variables including step frequency, step length, swing time, stance time, cycle time and double-support time were determined. Gait variability was quantified by the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of each variable. Left–right symmetry was calculated using the symmetry index (SI) and symmetry angle (SA). Paired t-tests (α = 0.05) were performed to identify difference between the beginning and the end of the protocol for each measured variable. Spatio-temporal gait characteristics did not differ between the beginning and the end of exercise. Gait variability of the double-support time increased at the end as measured by both SD (P = 0.037) and CV (P = 0.030) but no change was observed for other variables. Left–right symmetry measured using either SI or SA did not differ between sessions. In summary, spatio-temporal gait characteristics and symmetry while wearing firefighting equipment are insensitive to physiological fatigue. Prolonged walking in heat while wearing firefighting equipment may increase gait variability and therefore the likelihood of a fall. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential relationship between fatigue and gait variability and to investigate the possible influence of individual variation.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between baseline physical training and the use of firefighting thermal protective clothing (TPC) with breathing apparatus on functional balance. Twenty-three male firefighters performed a functional balance test under four gear/clothing conditions. Participants were divided into groups by physical training status, and task performance was analyzed. There was an effect of equipment and training status on performance with the group reporting both aerobic and resistance training performing better than the group reporting no physical training. In conclusion, firefighters walk more slowly as a strategy to maintain balance when wearing TPC, which may be suboptimal given the emergent nature of fire suppression. This result was most prominent in the group reporting no physical training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an essential role in the communication between cells and transport of diagnostically significant molecules. A wide diversity of approaches utilizing different biochemical properties of EVs and a lack of accepted protocols make data interpretation very challenging. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review consolidates the data on the classical and state-of-the-art methods for isolation of EVs, including exosomes, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Various characteristics of individual methods, including isolation efficiency, EV yield, properties of isolated EVs, and labor consumption are compared. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: A mixed population of vesicles is obtained in most studies of EVs for all used isolation methods. The properties of an analyzed sample should be taken into account when planning an experiment aimed at studying and using these vesicles. The problem of adequate EVs isolation methods still remains; it might not be possible to develop a universal EV isolation method but the available protocols can be used towards solving particular types of problems. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: With the wide use of EVs for diagnosis and therapy of various diseases the evaluation of existing methods for EV isolation is one of the key problems in modern biology and medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE: The effects of 60 days of head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) with and without the application of a reactive jump countermeasure were investigated, using a method which enables to discriminate between pulmonary ([Formula: see text]O(2)pulm) and muscular ([Formula: see text]O(2)musc) oxygen uptake kinetics to control for hemodynamic influences. METHODS: 22 subjects were randomly allocated to either a group performing a reactive jumps countermeasure (JUMP; n = 11, male, 29 ± 7 years, 23.9 ± 1.3 kg m(- 2)) or a control group (CTRL; n = 11, male, 29 ± 6 years, 23.3 ± 2.0 kg m(- 2)). Heart rate (HR) and [Formula: see text]O(2)pulm were measured in response to repeated changes in work rate between 30 and 80 W before (BDC-9) and two times after HDBR (R+ 2, R+ 13). Kinetic responses of HR, [Formula: see text]O(2)pulm, and [Formula: see text]O(2)musc were assessed applying time series analysis. Higher maxima in cross-correlation functions (CCF(max)(x)) between work rate and the respective parameter indicate faster kinetics responses. Statistical analysis was performed applying multifactorial analysis of variance. RESULTS: CCF(max)([Formula: see text]O(2)musc) and CCF(max)([Formula: see text]O(2)pulm) were not significantly different before and after HDBR (P > 0.05). CCF(max)(HR) decreased following bed rest (JUMP: BDC-9: 0.30 ± 0.09 vs. R+ 2: 0.28 ± 0.06 vs. R+13: 0.28 ± 0.07; CTRL: 0.35 ± 0.09 vs. 0.27 ± 0.06 vs. 0.33 ± 0.07 P = 0.025). No significant differences between the groups were observed (P > 0.05). Significant alterations were found for CCF(max) of mean arterial blood pressure (mBP) after HDBR (JUMP: BDC-9: 0.21 ± 0.07 vs. R+ 2: 0.30 ± 0.13 vs. R+ 13: 0.28 ± 0.08; CTRL: 0.25 ± 0.07 vs. 0.38 ± 0.13 vs. 0.28 ± 0.08; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Despite hemodynamic changes, [Formula: see text]O(2) kinetics seem to be preserved for a longer period of HDBR, even without the application of a countermeasure.

AB  - The giant sarcomeric protein titin has multiple important functions in striated muscle cells. Due to its gigantic size, its central position in the sarcomere and its elastic I-band domains, titin is a scaffold protein that is important for sarcomere assembly, and serves as a molecular spring that defines myofilament distensibility. This review focuses on the emerging role of titin in mechanosensing and hypertrophic signaling, and further highlights recent evidence that links titin to sarcomeric protein turnover.

AB  - Heat flux conditions measured in seven room fires are discussed. The conditions varied from just below flashover in a sparsely furnished bedroom to flashover and severe postflashover fire in a typically furnished recreation room. These heat flux conditions are compared with the protection level provided by fire fighter turnout coats conforming to NFPA 1971,Protective Clothing for Structural Fire Fighting. This standard requires that the turnout coat or pants assembly must protect the wearer against second degree burns when a heat flux of 84 kW/m2 (2 cal/cm2.s) is applied to its outside surface for a minimum of 17.5 seconds [“thermal protective performance (TPP) of 35”]. The results imply that fire fighters have only ten seconds or less to escape under most flashover conditions. However, the turnout coats provide good protection in many other fire situations. Practical definitions for flashover are given, and possible means for making the TPP test more relevant for research and development work are discussed.

AB  - In studies to determine whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced estrogens, the organism was grown in culture media prepared using distilled water autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks. The yeast-conditioned media showed the presence of a substance that competed with [3H]estradiol for binding to estrogen receptors (ER) from rat uterus. However, it soon became clear that the estrogenic substance in the conditioned media was not a product of the yeast grown in culture, but was leached out of the polycarbonate flasks during the autoclaving procedure. [3H]Estradiol displacement activity was monitored by ER RRA, and the active substance was purified from autoclaved medium using a series of HPLC steps. The final purified product was identified as bisphenol-A (BPA) by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. BPA could also be identified in distilled water autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks without the requirement of either the organism or the constituents of the culture medium. Authentic BPA was active in competitive RRAs, demonstrating an affinity approximately 1:2000 that of estradiol for ER. In functional assays, BPA (10-25 nM) induced progesterone receptors in cultured human mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) at a potency of approximately 1:5000 compared to that of estradiol. The BPA effect on PR induction was blocked by tamoxifen. In addition, BPA (25 nM) increased the rate of proliferation of MCF-7 cells assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Thus, BPA exhibited estrogenic activity by both RRA and two functional bioresponse assays. Finally, MCF-7 cells grown in media prepared with water autoclaved in polycarbonate exhibited higher progesterone receptor levels than cells.grown in media prepared with water autoclaved in glass, suggesting an estrogenic effect of the water autoclaved in polycarbonate. Our findings raise the possibility that unsuspected estrogenic activity in the form of BPA may have an impact on experiments employing media autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks. It remains to be determined whether BPA derived from consumer products manufactured from polycarbonate could significantly contribute to the pool of estrogenic substances in the environment.

AB  - Within the last years, the interest in physical exercise as non-invasive stimulus influencing circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (CPC) concentrations has constantly grown. Cell estimates are often derived by determining the subgroup of CPC as percent lymphocytes (LYM) or mononuclear cells (MNC) via flow cytometry and back calculation over whole blood (WB) cell counts. However, results might depend on the used cell isolation technique and/or gating strategy. We aimed to investigate MNC loss and apoptosis during the flow cytometry sample preparation process preceded by either density gradient centrifugation (DGC) or red blood cell lysis (RBCL) and the potential difference between results derived from back calculation at different stages of cell isolation and from WB.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in firefighter protective clothing used under different conditions (fire suppression operations and live-fire enclosure simulations). Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UHPLC/FL) was applied to determine PAH content in the outer shell, moisture barrier (membrane), and thermal barrier layers of protective clothing. Analysis involved eight PAHs, with the total PAH concentration being strongly dependent on use conditions and clothing layer. The PAH concentration in clothing worn during fire suppression (43 ± 16–63 ± 26 μg g−1) was approx. 10–12 times higher as compared to that in clothing worn during live-fire simulation (4.0 ± 1.1–5.4 ± 1.4 μg g−1). The highest total PAH content (84 ± 41 μg g−1) was found in the membrane of clothing worn during fire suppression (approx. 50 times greater than in the case of live-fire simulation – 1.6 ± 0.99 μg g−1). Cleaning with the use of machine washing removed a considerable part of PAH contamination, with cleaning effectiveness ranging from 79 ± 14% for the outer shell, 63 ± 25% for the membrane to 58 ± 14% for the thermal barrier. Furthermore, in firefighter protective clothing worn during fire suppression operations higher PAH concentrations were detected in samples from the knee region as compared to those from the sleeves.

AB  - Gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR in skeletal muscle is routine in exercise studies. The reproducibility and reliability of the data fundamentally depend on how the experiments are performed and interpreted. Despite the popularity of the assay, there is a considerable variation in experimental protocols and data analyses from different laboratories, and there is a lack of consistency of proper quality control steps throughout the assay. In this study, we present a number of experiments on various steps of quantitative PCR workflow, and demonstrate how to perform a quantitative PCR experiment with human skeletal muscle samples in an exercise study. We also tested some common mistakes in performing qPCR. Interestingly, we found that mishandling of muscle for a short time span (10 mins) before RNA extraction did not affect RNA quality, and isolated total RNA was preserved for up to one week at room temperature. Demonstrated by our data, use of unstable reference genes lead to substantial differences in the final results. Alternatively, cDNA content can be used for data normalisation; however, complete removal of RNA from cDNA samples is essential for obtaining accurate cDNA content.

AB  - This paper presents data on the movement speeds of occupants with various types of mobility impairments evacuating two residential facilities for older adults located on the East Coast of the USA with the goal of better understanding of behavior and movement speeds during stairwell evacuation with and without assistance. The building populations who took part in the current study comprised a diverse array of older adults and disabled residents descending the stairwells by the following methods: self-evacuation without assistance, assistance using a cane, assistance from another occupant or firefighter, or assistance using a stair chair. Movement data of these specific groups were compared and contrasted with other data collected on mobility-impaired individuals. In the current study, the National Institute of Standards and Technology observed overall average speeds of 0.31 ± 0.16 m/s (with individual speeds ranging from 0.07 to 0.91 m/s), which in some cases, approximate the speeds of disabled people and older adults found in earlier studies, and in other cases are slower than those observed in previous studies. Slower speeds reported here may have resulted from observing a wider variety of mobility impairments (because one of the buildings observed was an assisted-living facility) and from evacuation assistance provided by untrained populations. These data provide an adequate confirmation of exiting literature values typically used for disabled movement speeds in addition to updated values for future analyses.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was twofold: (1) to determine the isometric force and electromyographic (EMG) relationship of the sternocleidomastoid, splenii and trapezii muscles bilaterally in graded and maximal exertions in the sagittal, coronal and oblique planes. and (2) to develop regression equations to predict force based on the EMG scores. A newly designed and validated cervical isometric strength testing device was used to measure the cervical muscle isometric strength and force/EMG relationship in cervical flexion, extension, bilateral lateral flexion, bilateral anterolateral flexion, and bilateral posterolateral extension, all beginning with an upright seated neutral posture. A group of 40 healthy subjects were asked to exert their cervical motions in the directions of interest, while the force output and EMG from the sternocleidomastoids, splenii, and trapezii were sampled bilaterally at 1 kHz. ANOVA, correlation, and regression analyses were carried out. The force and EMG scores were significantly different between the directions of effort (P<0.01). All regressions were significant (P<0.01). All subjects registered the highest forces in pure extension and the lowest in pure flexion, showing a gradual decrease from the posterior to anterior direction. There was a modest correlation between EMG of the investigated muscles and force (r=0.15-0.76, P<0.01). EMG output was, for example, approximately 66% higher in flexion than in extension (while force output was roughly 30% less in flexion than extension) - thus relatively more muscle activity was required in flexion than extension to generate a given force. The intermediate positions (i.e. anterolateral flexion) revealed force/EMG ratio scores that were intermediate in relation to the force/EMG ratios for pure flexion and pure extension. The cervical muscle strength and cervical muscle EMG are therefore dependent on the direction of effort.

AB  - One method of evaluating the degree of neurologic impairment in MS has been the combination of grades (0 = normal to 5 or 6 = maximal impairment) within 8 Functional Systems (FS) and an overall Disability Status Scale (DSS) that had steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). A new Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is presented, with each of the former steps (1,2,3 . . . 9) now divided into two (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 . . . 9.5). The lower portion is obligatorily defined by Functional System grades. The FS are Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Brain Stem, Sensory, Bowel & Bladder, Visual, Cerebral, and Other; the Sensory and Bowel & Bladder Systems have been revised. Patterns of FS and relations of FS by type and grade to the DSS are demonstrated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, there has been an increasing need for a reliable and practical tool for assessing fatigue-related impairment in the field. This study investigated the sensitivity of one potential tool, a 5-min version of the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) specifically designed for use on personal digital assistants (PDA), to 28 h of sustained wakefulness. METHODS: There were 15 participants who slept in the laboratory overnight then remained awake from 08:00 (Day 1) to 12:00 (Day 2). During every second hour, they completed a 10-min PVT, a sustained attention task that is sensitive to the effects of sleep loss and fatigue, and a 5-min PDA-PVT. RESULTS: While performance on both tasks significantly varied as a function of hours of wakefulness, responses on the PDA-PVT were typically slower than on the PVT. When performance scores were standardized, the negative impact of increasing hours of wakefulness on performance on the 5-min PDA-PVT and 10-min PVT did not significantly differ. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that the 5-min PDA-PVT may provide a reasonable substitute for the 10-min PVT, particularly in circumstances where a shorter test is required and/or the standard PVT is not as practical.

AB  - Nutrition assessment is a necessary first step in advising athletes on dietary strategies that include dietary supplementation, and in evaluating the effectiveness of supplementation regimens. Although dietary assessment is the cornerstone component of the nutrition assessment process, it should be performed within the context of a complete assessment that includes collection/evaluation of anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and environmental data. Collection of dietary intake data can be challenging, with the potential for significant error of validity and reliability, which include inherent errors of the collection methodology, coding of data by dietitians, estimation of nutrient composition using nutrient food tables and/or dietary software programs, and expression of data relative to reference standards including eating guidance systems, macronutrient guidelines for athletes, and recommended dietary allowances. Limitations in methodologies used to complete anthropometric assessment and biochemical analysis also exist, as reference norms for the athlete are not well established and practical and reliable biomarkers are not available for all nutrients. A clinical assessment collected from history information and the nutrition-focused physical exam may help identify overt nutrient deficiencies but may be unremarkable in the well-trained athlete. Assessment of potential food-drug interactions and environmental components further helps make appropriate dietary and supplement recommendations. Overall, the assessment process can help the athlete understand that supplement intake cannot make up for poor food choices and an inadequate diet, while a healthy diet helps ensure maximal benefit from supplementation. Establishment of reference norms specifically for well-trained athletes for the nutrition assessment process is a future research priority.

AB  - Essentially all biological processes fluctuate over the course of the day, manifesting as time-of-day-dependent variations with regards to the way in which organ systems respond to normal behaviors. For example, basic, translational, and epidemiologic studies indicate that temporal partitioning of metabolic processes governs the fate of dietary nutrients, in a manner in which concentrating caloric intake towards the end of the day is detrimental to both cardiometabolic and cardiovascular parameters. Despite appreciation that branched chain amino acids impact risk for obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure, it is currently unknown whether the time-of-day at which dietary BCAAs are consumed influence cardiometabolic/cardiovascular outcomes. Here, we report that feeding mice a BCAA-enriched meal at the end of the active period (i.e., last 4 h of the dark phase) rapidly increases cardiac protein synthesis and mass, as well as cardiomyocyte size; consumption of the same meal at the beginning of the active period (i.e., first 4 h of the dark phase) is without effect. This was associated with a greater BCAA-induced activation of mTOR signaling in the heart at the end of the active period; pharmacological inhibition of mTOR (through rapamycin) blocked BCAA-induced augmentation of cardiac mass and cardiomyocyte size. Moreover, genetic disruption of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock abolished time-of-day-dependent fluctuations in BCAA-responsiveness. Finally, we report that repetitive consumption of BCAA-enriched meals at the end of the active period accelerated adverse cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction. Thus, our data demonstrate that the timing of BCAA consumption has significant implications for cardiac health and disease.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE) on the determination of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) while using two different treadmill protocols: a progressive incline protocol (PIP) and a progressive speed protocol (PSP), with three clothing conditions (Light-light clothing; Boots-PPE with rubber boots; Shoes-PPE with running shoes). Bruce protocol with Light was performed for a reference test. Results showed there was no difference in VO2max between Bruce Light, PIP Light, and PSP Light. However, VO2max was reduced in Boots and Shoes with shortened maximal performance time (7 and 6 min reduced for PIP Boots and Shoes, respectively; 11 and 9 min reduced for PSP Boots and Shoes, respectively), whereas the increasing rate of VO2 in Boots and Shoes during submaximal exercise was greater compared with Light. Wearing firefighter boots compared with wearing running shoes also significantly affected submaximal VO2 but not VO2max. These results suggest that firefighters? maximal performance determined from a typical VO2max test without wearing PPE may overestimate the actual performance capability of firefighters wearing PPE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the components contributions of personal protective equipment on physiological strain in firefighters during exercise and recovery. Eight firefighters participated in trials in which various combinations of personal protective equipment components weighing from 1.3 to 15.1 kg were worn. The results showed that rectal temperature, changes in rectal temperature, mean skin temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption and blood lactate concentration were smaller in conditions without boots (no-boots) than in other conditions with no helmet, gloves or self-contained breathing apparatus (P < 0.05). Increases in rectal temperature per unit mass of personal protective equipment were approximately twice as small in no-boots condition as the other conditions. These results suggest that the reduction of the boots' mass might be more efficient to alleviate heat strain of firefighters wearing personal protective equipment, rather than the reduction of the mass of self-contained breathing apparatus, helmet or gloves.

AB  - Abstract Bisphenol-A polycarbonate gradually degrades at temperatures above 310°C. as detected by differential thermal analysis. The first stage of degradation of the dry and purified resin is induced by oxygen. In connection with oxidation, zinc stearate causes a notable degradation. This compound may act partly as an oxidation catalyst. The initial site attacked by oxygen is presumably the isopropylidene linkage of the polymer. The second stage of degradation shows a characteristic endothermic peak between 340 and 380°C. This stage is chiefly associated with depolymerization since only a small amount of volatiles is detectable. Depolymerization can be caused by hydroperoxide cleavage, hydrolysis, alcoholysis and bisphenol cleavage. Bisphenol-A can decompose in the presence of acid into phenol and isopropenylphenol. The latter compound is a color-forming material. As temperature increases above 400°C., volatilization rate gradually increases. The last stage of degradation becomes uncontrollable above 500°C. At this stage, decarboxylation, dehydration, hydrolysis, hydrogen abstraction, ether cleavage, crosslinking as well as chain scission interact to yield aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds, and tar. The quantity of aromatic hydrocarbons is determined by the intensity of the thermal degradation.

AB  - Firefighting is associated with an increased risk for a cardiovascular (CV) event, likely due to increased CV strain. The increase in CV strain during firefighting can be attributed to the interaction of several factors such as the strenuous physical demand, sympathetic nervous system activation, increased thermal burden, and the environmental exposure to smoke pollutants. Characterizing the impact of varying thermal burden and pollutant exposure on hemodynamics may help understand the CV burden experienced during firefighting. The purpose of this study was to examine the hemodynamic response of firefighters to training environments created by pallets and straw; oriented strand board (OSB); or simulated fire/smoke (fog). Twenty-three firefighters had brachial blood pressure measured and central blood pressure and hemodynamics estimated from the pressure waveform at baseline, and immediately and 30 minutes after each scenario. The training environment did not influence the hemodynamic response over time (interaction, p > 0.05); however, OSB scenarios resulted in higher pulse wave velocity and blood pressure (environment, p < 0.05). In conclusion, conducting OSB training scenarios appears to create the largest arterial burden in firefighters compared to other scenarios in this study. Environmental thermal burden in combination with the strenuous exercise, and psychological and environmental stress placed on firefighters should be considered when designing fire training scenarios and evaluating CV risk.

AB  - &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; Occupational readiness of structural firefighters is critical for safety, health, and job performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and firefighter (FF) occupational performance, fitness characteristics and physical activity measures.  &lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;  Twelve male structural firefighters (Age: 37.3 ± 7.6 yr; Height: 183.2 ± 7.1 cm; Body mass: 90.4 ± 13.7 kg) wore an accelerometer for 19.1 ± 5.8 days to quantify physical activity levels. HRV was assessed daily upon waking with a portable electric cardiogram device for 20.8 ± 4.6 days. HRV indices included SDNN, RMSSD, high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) components. FFs also completed a simulated fire ground test (SFGT) as well as a battery of fitness tests including estimated 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) shoulder press, deadlift, bench press, bent-over row, and kettlebell swing, and a submaximal prediction of aerobic capacity. HRV was assessed the day of the SFGT (acute HRV) and averaged over all days (chronic HRV). &lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Acute SDNN values were inversely correlated with SFGT time on 3 individual SFGT tasks (r=-.70 to -.75, p&amp;lt;.05) and the overall SFGT time (r=-.74, p=.016). Chronic HF was correlated with frequency of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (r=.73, p=.011). Chronic RMSSD and SDNN were also correlated with shoulder press (r=.89, p&amp;lt;.01; and r=.88, p&amp;lt;.01 respectively) and bench press strength (r=.78, p=.008; and r=.76, p=.011 respectively). &lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Acute HRV was correlated with SFGT performance, whereas chronic HRV was associated with physical activity and strength measures. These outcomes indicate that HRV parameters may reflect the physiological status of FFs and the complex interaction between HRV, physical activity and fitness outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Firefighters are occupationally exposed to an array of hazardous chemicals, and these exposures have been linked to the higher rates of some cancer in firefighters. However, additional research that characterizes firefighters' exposure is needed to fully elucidate the impacts on health risks. In this pilot study, we used silicone wristbands to quantify off-duty and on-duty chemical exposures experienced by 20 firefighters in Durham, North Carolina. By using each firefighter's off-duty wristband to represent individual baseline exposures, we assessed occupation-related exposures (i.e. on-duty exposures). We also investigated the influence of responding to a fire event while on-duty. In total, 134 chemicals were quantified using both GC-MS and LC-MS/MS targeted methods. Seventy-one chemicals were detected in at least 50% of all silicone wristbands, including 7 PFAS, which to our knowledge, have not been reported in wristbands previously. Of these, phthalates were generally measured at the highest concentrations, followed by brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate esters (OPEs). PFAS were measured at lower concentrations overall, but firefighter PFOS exposures while on-duty and responding to fires were 2.5 times higher than off-duty exposures. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), BFRs, and some OPEs were occupationally associated, with firefighters experiencing 0.5 to 8.5 times higher exposure while on-duty as compared to off-duty. PAH exposures were also higher for firefighters who respond to a fire than those who did not while on-duty. Additional research with a larger population of firefighters that builds upon this pilot investigation may further pinpoint exposure sources that may contribute to firefighters' risk for cancer, such as those from firefighter gear or directly from fires. This research demonstrates the utility of using silicone wristbands to quantify occupational exposure in firefighters and the ability to disentangle exposures that may be specific to fire events as opposed to other sources that firefighters might experience.

AB  - AbstractThis study investigated the effects of carrying a backpack while walking. Critical changes featuring the disproportionality of increases in trunk muscle activation and lumbar joint loading between light and heavy backpack carriage weight may reveal the load-bearing strategy (LBS) of the lumbar spine. This was investigated using an integrated system equipped with a motion analysis, a force platform and a wireless surface electromyography (EMG) system to measure the trunk muscle EMG amplitudes and lumbar joint component forces. A predictive goal programming model was developed to determine the most critical changes in trunk muscle activation and lumbar joint loading. Results suggested that lightweight backpack carriage at approximately 3% of body weight (BW) might reduce the peak lumbosacral compression force by 3% during walking compared with no load condition. The most critical changes in both trunk muscle activation and lumbosacral joint loading were found at a backpack load of 10% of BW.Practitioner Summary: This study investigated the effects of backpack load on the LBS of lumbar spine while walking. A backpack load of 3% of BW might reduce the peak lumbosacral compression force by 3 and 10% of BW induced the most critical changes in LBS of lumbar spine.

AB  - Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a life-threatening condition that affects mainly athletes, military personnel, firefighters, and occupational workers. EHS is frequently observed in non-compensable conditions (where the body is unable to maintain a steady thermal balance) as a result of heavy heat stress and muscle contraction associated with prolonged and strenuous physical and occupational activities, resulting in central nervous system dysfunction followed by multi-organ damage and failure. Since the pathophysiology of EHS is complex and involves multiple organs and systems, any condition that changes the interrelated systems may increase the risk for EHS. It has been suggested that exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) can lead to thermoregulatory impairment and systemic inflammation, which could be a potential predisposing factor for EHS. In this review article, we aim to (1) address the evidence of EIMD as a predisposing factor for EHS and (2) propose a possible mechanism of how performing muscle-damaging exercise in the heat may aggravate muscle damage and subsequent risk of EHS and acute kidney injury (AKI). Such an understanding could be meaningful to minimize the risks of EHS and AKI for individuals with muscle damage due to engaging in physical work in hot environments.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the energy expenditure associated with load carriage using both a traditional rucksack and a new rucksack design, the AARN rucksack, which incorporates front balance pockets. Nine volunteers walked at 3 km h(-1) at various uphill and downhill gradients on a treadmill without a load and carrying a load of 25.6 kg in each of the rucksacks. The oxygen consumption associated with both of the loading conditions was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that associated with unloaded walking at all downhill gradients tested, although there was no significant difference between the two loading conditions. During the uphill gradients the oxygen consumption associated with the AARN pack was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that associated with the traditional pack at the 0%, 5%, 10% and 20% gradients. The mean (%) differences at these gradients, expressed in ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) were 1.18 (9%), 1.45 (8%), 1.76 (8%) and 1.88 (6%), respectively. On average for the whole protocol, the oxygen consumption associated with the AARN rucksack was 5% lower than that associated with the traditional rucksack [mean (SD) 17.28 (7.46) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) for the AARN pack and 18.20 (7.84) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) for the traditional pack]. The findings of the present study suggest that a load carriage system that allows the load to be distributed between the back and font of the trunk is more appropriate for carrying relatively heavy loads than a system that loads the back only.

AB  - This study assessed changes in kinetics from unloaded walking associated with load carriage using both a traditional and a new rucksack design that incorporates front balance pockets (AARN). Nine subjects walked at 3(+/-0.05) km x h(-1) over a force plate unloaded and carrying 25.6 kg in each of the rucksacks. The order of trials was randomized and speed-controlled by use of photoelectric cells and a millisecond timer. Anteroposterior and vertical ground reaction forces were analyzed using repeated measures ANCOVA (speed covariate). There was a trend for the AARN pack to elicit a shorter support time than the traditional pack, 1.025+/-0.049 versus 1.037+/-0.06 s (p = 0.056), while the unloaded condition produced the shortest support time, 1.016+/-0.04 s. Both braking and propulsive forces for the rucksacks were significantly greater than for unloaded walking. While there was no significant difference between the packs for the braking force, the AARN pack produced a significantly lower (p<0.05) propulsive force than the traditional rucksack, 0.79+/-0.2 versus 0.94+/-0.16 N x kg bodyweight(-1). Both rucksacks produced significantly greater (p<0.001) vertical force peaks than unloaded walking, the increases being proportional to the increase in system weight. These findings indicate that there may be some advantage in terms of propulsive force production for the front/back system.

AB  - The 10-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) has often been used to assess the impact of sleep loss on performance. Due to time constraints, however, regular testing may not be practical in field studies. The aim of the present study was to examine the suitability of tests shorter than 10 min. in duration. Changes in performance across a night of sustained wakefulness were compared during a standard 10-min PVT, the first 5 min of the PVT, and the first 2 min of the PVT. Four performance metrics were assessed: (1) mean reaction time (RT), (2) fastest 10% of RT, (3) lapse percentage, and (4) slowest 10% of RT. Performance during the 10-min PVT significantly deteriorated with increasing wakefulness for all metrics. Performance during the first 5 min and the first 2 min of the PVT deteriorated in a manner similar to that observed for the whole 10-min task, with all metrics except lapse percentage displaying significant impairment across the night. However, the shorter the task sampling time, the less sensitive the test is to sleepiness. Nevertheless, the 5-min PVT may provide a viable alternative to the 10-min PVT for some performance metrics.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality among men in the developed world. Conventional anti-PCa therapies are not effective for patients with advanced and/or metastatic disease. In most cases, cancer therapies fail due to an incomplete depletion of tumor cells, resulting in tumor relapse. Exosomes are involved in tumor progression, promoting the angiogenesis and migration of tumor cells during metastasis. These structures contribute to the dissemination of pathogenic agents through interaction with recipient cells. Exosomes may deliver molecules that are able to induce the transdifferentiation process, known as "epithelial to mesenchymal transition". The composition of exosomes and the associated possibilities of interacting with cells make exosomes multifaceted regulators of cancer development. Extracellular vesicles have biophysical properties, such as stability, biocompatibility, permeability, low toxicity and low immunogenicity, which are key for the successful development of an innovative drug delivery system. They have an enhanced circulation stability and bio-barrier permeation ability, and they can therefore be used as effective chemotherapeutic carriers to improve the regulation of target tissues and organs. Exosomes have the capacity to deliver different types of cargo and to target specific cells. Chemotherapeutics, natural products and RNA have been encapsulated for the treatment of prostate cancers.

AB  - Every fire fighter needs to wear fire-protective clothing and a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) several times a year while carrying out various fire-fighting and rescue operations in hazardous work environments. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effects of a multilayer turnout suit designed to fulfil European standard EN 469 used over standardized (Nordic) clothing and with SCBA (total mass 25.9 kg) on maximal physical work performance, and to evaluate the relationship between individual characteristics and power output with the fire-protective clothing system and SCBA. The subjects were 12 healthy firemen aged 26-46 years. The range of their body mass, body fat and maximal oxygen consumption was 69-101 kg, 10-20% and 2.70-5.86 l.min-1, respectively. The maximal tests without (control) and with the fire-protective clothing system and SCBA were carried out on a treadmill in a thermoneutral environment. When compared to the control test, the decrease in the maximal power output in terms of maximal working time and walking speed averaged 25% (P < 0.001) varying from 18% to 34% with the fire-protective clothing system and SCBA. At maximum, no significant differences were found in pulmonary ventilation, absolute oxygen consumption, the respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, the rate-pressure product, mechanical efficiency, and the rating of perceived exertion between the tests with and without the fire-protective clothing system and SCBA. The reduction of the power output was related to the extra mass of the fire protective clothing and SCBA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The effects of a pressure demand-type self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) (total weight, 15.5 kg) on breathing pattern, gas exchange, and heart rate were studied in 13 firemen. The subjects performed sequential progressive exercise tests on a treadmill both without and with an SCBA. The use of an SCBA consistently limited tidal volume. During submaximal exercise oxygen consumption and heart rate increased remarkably more with the SCBA than without it. Four subjects reached their maximal heart rate with the SCBA. Their mean ventilation rate was 68% and oxygen consumption was 83% of the maximal values attained without the SCBA. The shoulder harness of the heavy SCBA prevented free motion of the thorax, affecting the regulation of breathing, and thus seriously disturbed ventilation and gas exchange, particularly at heavier exercise levels.

AB  - A submaximal job-related test drill was developed for assessing physical work capacity of fire-fighters at worksites. The drill with the fixed maximal working time of 14.5 min consists of five common smoke-diving (entry into a smoke-filled space) tasks done with full personal protective equipment. Cardiac strain of the drill and its dependence on the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and age were studied with 59 experienced male fire-fighters aged 27-54 years. Their VO2max ranged from 29.7 to 67.0 ml/min/kg for cycling. Heart rate (HR) in the tasks of the drill was 91-184 beats/min corresponding to cardiac strain of 49-99% of the maximal HR. The estimated mean VO2 of the drill was 26 ml/min/kg and 2.1 l/min (56% VO2max). Cardiac strain was significantly related to VO2max (r = -0.50, p&lt; 0.001) but insignificantly to age. The test drill efficiently rated fire-fighters according to their physical work capacity, and showed to be a valid and feasible method for the use in fire stations. © 1994.

Their average maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was 64.9 ml X min-1 X kg-1. Sequential tests without and with the respirator were performed on a treadmill. The continuous test contained five components, each of which lasted 5 min: sitting at rest, walking at 20%, 40%, and 60% of the individual VO2 max, and recovery sitting. During the higher submaximal work levels and recovery, ventilation, heart rate, and oxygen consumption in particular increased more with respirators than without them. At the highest work level the increments in oxygen consumption caused by the respirators were 13%, (8.7 ml X min-1 X kg-1), 7% (4.4 ml X min-1 X kg-1), and 20% (12.7 ml X min-1 X kg-1) of VO2 max. All three respirators hampered respiration, resulting in hypoventilation. The additional effort of breathing and the weight of the apparatus (15 kg with the SCBA ) increased the subjects' cardiorespiratory strain so clearly that the need for rest periods and the individual's work capacity when the respirators are worn must be carefully considered, particularly with the SCBA .

AB  - While wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus and fire-protective clothing, 35 healthy firefighting students aged 19-27 years performed smoke-diving (entry into a smoke-filled room) during a simulated shipboard fire. The mean (+/- SD) ambient temperature inside the simulator was 119 +/- 12 degrees C, and the task lasted 17 +/- 4 min. All subjects were fit according to their maximal oxygen consumption, which was 52.4 +/- 5.2 mL/min/kg (4.08 +/- 0.45 l/min). During the smoke-diving the average heart rate was 150 +/- 13 beats/min (79 +/- 6% of maximal heart rate attained in a cycle-ergometer test), and the peak heart rate was 180 +/- 13 beats/min (95 +/- 6% of maximal heart rate). The estimated oxygen consumption was 2.4 +/- 0.5 L/min (60 +/- 12% of maximal oxygen consumption). Neither ability to tolerate stress (as determined by the instructors) nor previous experience in smoke-diving tasks seemed to influence the heart rate or estimated oxygen consumption during experiment. Smoke-diving was physically very demanding even for the young and fit subjects, showing the importance of regular evaluation of the health and physical fitness of every firefighter who has to carry out smoke-diving tasks.

AB  - Fish oil and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) belong to a popular class of food supplements known as "fat supplements", which are claimed to reduce muscle glycogen breakdown, reduce body mass, as well as reduce muscle damage and inflammatory responses. Sport athletes consume fish oil and CLA mainly to increase lean body mass and reduce body fat. Recent evidence indicates that this kind of supplementation may have other side-effects and a new role has been identified in steroidogenensis. Preliminary findings demonstrate that fish oil and CLA may induce a physiological increase in testosterone synthesis. The aim of this review is to describe the effects of fish oil and CLA on physical performance (endurance and resistance exercise), and highlight the new results on the effects on testosterone biosynthesis. In view of these new data, we can hypothesize that fat supplements may improve the anabolic effect of exercise.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare ranges of motion (ROM) between dominant and nondominant sides for the joints of the upper and lower extremities. METHODS: Ninety healthy white women from 18 to 59 years of age were measured in this study. Active and passive ROM were measured for the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, and wrist using a standard goniometer. The order of the joints, motion, sides, and active or passive motion testing was randomly selected. A paired t test was used for the comparison between sides. RESULTS: The results of this study showed a statistically significant difference between dominant and nondominant sides for 34 of the 60 ROM measured. The maximum mean difference between sides for all ROM measured was 7.5 degrees . CONCLUSION: The results of this show that some ROM are different between body sides and that when these differences exist they are minimal and may not be clinically insignificant. These results support the practice of using the opposite side of the body as an indicator of preinjury or normal extremity ROM.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic fluorinated compounds that are highly bioaccumulative and persistent organic pollutants. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an eight-carbon chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid, was used heavily for the production of fluoropolymers, but concerns have led to its replacement by shorter carbon chain homologues such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). However, limited toxicity data exist for these substitutes. We evaluated the toxicity of PFOA, PFHxA and PFBA on a zebrafish liver cell line and investigated the effects of exposure on cell metabolism. Gross toxicity after 96 h of exposure was highest for PFOA and PFO(-) , while PFHxA and PFBA exhibited lower toxicity. Although the structural similarity of these compounds to fatty acids suggests the possibility of interference with the transport and metabolism of lipids, we could not detect any differential expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar-α, -β and -γ), fabp3 and crot genes after 96 h exposure to up to 10 ppm of the test compounds. However, we observed localized lipid droplet accumulation only in PFBA-exposed cells. To study the effects of these compounds on cell metabolism, we conducted fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy using naturally fluorescent biomarkers, NADH and FAD. The fluorescence lifetimes of NADH and FAD and the bound/free ratio of each of these coenzymes decreased in a dose- and carbon length-dependent manner, suggesting disruption of cell metabolism. In sum, our study revealed that PFASs with shorter carbon chains are less toxic than PFOA, and that exposure to sublethal dosage of PFOA, PFHxA or PFBA affects cell metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the inflammatory response to a 12-hour wildfire suppression shift, in firefighters attending the "Black Saturday" natural disaster. METHODS: Thirty-eight male volunteer firefighters provided venous blood samples before and after a 12-hour firefighting shift. Pre- to post-shift changes in pro-inflammatory (Interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12P70, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interferon-gamma [IFNγ]), and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-10, IL-13) cytokines were measured with paired sample t tests, or Wilcoxon t tests for non-parametric data. RESULTS: Interleukin (IL)-6 (P = 0.003) and IL-8 (P = 0.017) were significantly increased following 12-hours of wildfire suppression. There was also a significant decrease in IL-10 (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The observed acute inflammatory response may have resulted from multiple stressors including physical exertion, thermal strain, or smoke inhalation experienced during the shift, and may be a necessary response for the body to adapt to stressor exposure.

AB  - We investigated the role of fatigue in muscle strain injuries using the extensor digitorum longus muscles of 48 rabbits. The muscles of the rabbits were fatigued by 25% or 50% then stretched to failure and compared with the contralateral controls. Three rates of stretch were used. The force to muscle failure was reduced in the fatigued leg in all groups (range, 93% to 97.4% compared with the controls). The change in muscle length in the fatigue groups was not different from the controls. The amount of energy absorbed in the fatigued muscle was 69.7% to 92% that of the energy absorbed in the control muscle. The lowest energy absorption occurred in muscles that were more fatigued. In eight additional rabbits, fatigued extensor digitorum longus muscles were compared with submaximally stimulated muscles with the equivalent contractile properties, and no difference was seen. Muscles subjected to strains are frequently injured under high-intensity eccentric loading conditions. Under these conditions, muscles absorb energy and provide control and regulation of limb movement. Our data showed that muscles are injured at the same length, regardless of the effects of fatigue. However, fatigued muscles are able to absorb less energy before reaching the degree of stretch that causes injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exosomes, cell-derived vesicles encompassing lipids, DNA, proteins coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are present in diverse body fluids. They offer novel biomarker and drug therapy potential for diverse diseases, including cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using gene ontology, exosomal genes database and GeneCards metadata analysis tools, a database of cancer-associated protein coding genes and ncRNAs (n=2,777) was established. Variant analysis, expression profiling and pathway mapping were used to identify putative pancreatic cancer exosomal gene candidates. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-five protein-coding genes, 26 RNA genes and one pseudogene directly associated with pancreatic cancer were identified in the study. Nine open reading frames (ORFs) encompassing enzymes, apoptosis and transcriptional regulators, and secreted factors and five cDNAs (enzymes) emerged from the analysis. Among the ncRNA class, 26 microRNAs (miRs), one pseudogene, one long noncoding RNA (LNC) and one antisense gene were identified. Furthermore, 22 exosome-associated protein-coding targets (a cytokine, enzymes, membrane glycoproteins, receptors, and a transporter) emerged as putative leads for pancreatic cancer therapy. Seven of these protein-coding targets are FDA-approved and the drugs-based on these could provide repurposing opportunities for pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSION: The database of exosomal genes established in this study provides a framework for developing novel biomarkers and drug therapy targets for pancreatic cancer.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. OBJECTIVES: To compare two devices for measuring cervical range of motion, a three-dimensional ultrasound motion device (Zebris) and a gravity-reference goniometer (Myrin). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Assessment of cervical range of motion is used to evaluate the effect of different treatments, determine impairment, and ascertain the relationship between neck disorders and cervical spine mobility. METHODS: Sixty "neck-healthy" volunteers (25 men, 35 women; mean age 38 years, range 22-58 years) performed active maximal movements in flexion-extension, rotation, and lateral flexion. Maximal cervical range of motion was recorded simultaneously with the Zebris and Myrin devices. Intradevice reliability, concurrent validity, intertester comparison, intratester reliability, and intraindividual variability were computed. RESULTS: Our study showed good agreement of full-cycle cervical range of motion measurement between devices, testers, and the test and retest (intraclass correlation [ICC] was >0.90 for intradevice reliability, >0.93 for concurrent validity, and >0.92 for intratester reliability). Method error, assessed with the within-subject coefficient of variation for 95% of the measurements, was 5.4% to 11.1% for intradevice reliability, 4.4% to 7.6% for concurrent validity, 3.6% to 7.6% for intratester reliability, and 5.3% to 9.9% for individual variability. Individual variability did not increase with an increased cervical range of motion. CONCLUSION: Both devices are reliable and showed good agreement. We conclude that the two techniques can be used interchangeably. Our study supports the continued use of the Myrin-a gravity-reference goniometer in routine clinical orthopedic work. The more sophisticated three-dimensional method adds information and allows evaluation of combined motion in two and three dimensions and is suitable for research.

AB  - Intense exertion is an occupational hazard inherent to fire fighting. This study was designed to look at the exertion levels that fire fighters attain during a fire fighting exercise when using (1) no self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), (2) light SCBA, and (3) heavy SCBA. Exertion levels were measured as a function of the heart rate increase relative to the maximum predicted heart rate determined by a standard treadmill exercise test. Five fire fighters wore electrocardiographic monitors during a routine fire fighting exercise. Heart rates increased rapidly to 70% to 80% of maximum within the first minute and then plateaued at 90% to 100% until the attack on the fire was completed. There was no significant difference between exertion levels when using no SCBA, light SCBA, and heavy SCBA (split-plot analysis of variance, p greater than .25). These results suggest that fire fighters attain an intense level of physical activity quickly and maintain that level as long as they are actively engaged in fighting fire. These results also suggest that regardless of the weight of the SCBA, if employed, fire fighters exert themselves from 85% to 100% of their maximum and adjust their work output to maintain that near-maximal level.

AB  - Range of motion tests are often employed in the quantification of musculoskeletal impairment and in the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The aim of the present study was to compare the absolute values for, and the day-to-day reliability of, measures of cervical spinal mobility made with two computerised motion analysis devices. The ranges of cervical flexion, extension, lateral bending, axial rotation, and axial rotation in flexion and extension were determined for 19 volunteers using both the CA6000 Spine Motion Analyser and the Zebris CMS system; all measures were repeated on a second occasion 1-3 days later. The test-retest reliability was good for each instrument: there was no significant difference between the mean values derived on the two separate days (P>0.05), and the corresponding intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.75-0.93 for all pri-O mary movements and 0.57-0.93 for axial rotation in flexion or in extension. For each primary movement, a small but significant difference (1-10%; P<0.05) between the values derived from the two instruments was observed, the systematic nature of which was revealed by the excellent correlation coefficients between them. For the measures of axial rotation in flexion or in extension, however, there was not only a poor correlation between the data obtained from the two devices, but the mean values also differed significantly. Each device is highly reliable in itself and can be used with confidence in longitudinal studies. The establishment of 'normal' values for the primary motions should take account of the slight differences observed between devices. Normal values for rotation in flexion or extension cannot be established until the source of the device-dependent difference is identified.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Wildland firefighters (WLFF) work long hours in extreme environments, resulting in high daily total energy expenditure. Increasing work-shift eating episodes and/or providing rations that promote convenient eating has shown augmented self-selected work output, as has regular carbohydrate (CHO) consumption. It remains unclear how current WLFF feeding strategies compare to more frequent nutrient delivery. Our aim was to determine WLFFs' self-selected field total energy intake (TEI), composition, and feeding patterns during wildland fire suppression shifts. METHODS: WLFF were deployed to fire incidents across the United States throughout the 2018 fire season. Preshift food inventories collected at basecamp provided item-specific nutrient content (kilocalories, CHO, fat, protein). Work shift consumption (TEI, feeding frequency, episodic composition) was monitored in real time by field researchers on fireline via observational data capture using mobile tablets. Shift work output was also quantified via actigraph accelerometry. RESULTS: Eighty-six WLFF (27.5±6.4 y; 16 female, 70 male) worked 14.0±1.1 h shifts, with a TEI of 6.3±2.5 MJ (1494±592 kcal) (51±10, 37±9, 13±4% for CHO, fat, and protein, respectively). WLFF averaged 4.3±1.6 eating episodes (1.4±1.3 MJ [345±306 kcal] and 44±38 g CHO·episode(-1)). WLFF who consumed >20 kcal·kg(-1) averaged less sedentary activity than those consuming <16 kcal·kg(-1). Data are presented as mean±SD. CONCLUSIONS: Not including fire camp meals (breakfast, dinner), the present work-shift TEI approximates 33% of previously determined WLFF total energy expenditure and demonstrates that current WLFF consumption patterns may not deliver adequate nutrients for occupational demands.

AB  - In order to determine the effect of loads worn or carried on walking mechanics, 11 men and 11 women were filmed using high speed cinematography as they performed overground walking at 1.78 m/s under five load conditions. The loads included a baseline condition in which subjects carried no added load, and additional loads of approximately 9, 17, 29 and 36 kg consisting of standard military items. The latter two loads were added in the form of a framed rucksack system. Values for several variables frequently used to describe temporal and kinematic characteristics of walking were quantified from the film. These included stride length, stride rate, single leg support time, double-support time, swing time and the forward inclination of the trunk. The results of the study demonstrated that the males and females displayed significantly different gait patterns under all load conditions. Not unexpectedly, the females required a higher rate of stepping than the males because of their shorter stride lengths. The results also demonstrated that the walking patterns of both the male and female subjects were affected by the increases in carried load. In general, stride length and swing time decreased while stride rate and double-support time increased with increases in load. There was also an increased forward inclination of the trunk but only for the two heaviest loads which were carried in a rucksack. While the changes in gait characteristics were relatively small for the male subjects, the females were affected to a greater extent thereby demonstrating a greater sensitivity to load magnitude. It was concluded that careful consideration must be given to the absolute loads carried by males and females. Not only is it important for load requirements to be lower for females because of the physiological implications but also because of biomechanical implications and the associated mechanical stresses which must be endured during locomotion. While this study was directed primarily towards military applications, the results should also have implications for load carrying in a variety of situations and environments, including industrial and recreational applications. The results of the study demonstrated that the females required a higher rate of stepping than the males because of their shorter stride lengths. The results also demonstrated that the walking patterns of both the male and female subjects were affected by the increases in carried load. In general, stride length and swing time decreased while stride rate and double-support time increased with increases in load. There was also an increased forward inclination of the trunk but only for the two heaviest loads which were carried in a rucksack. While the changes in gait characteristics were relatively small for the male subjects, the females were affected to a greater extent thereby demonstrating a greater sensitivity to load magnitude.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic stress may be a risk factor for coronary heart disease and is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We tested the hypotheses that two markers of HPA axis dysregulation, elevated average level (area under the curve, adjusted for time awake) and diurnal decline of salivary cortisol, were associated with presence of coronary calcification (CaC). METHOD: Seven hundred eighteen black and white middle-aged adults enrolled in an ancillary study of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults provided six salivary cortisol samples throughout one full day and had measurements of CaC. RESULTS: The prevalence of any calcification was low, 8.1% in the participants of the ancillary study, with white men having the highest proportion. Average cortisol did not differentiate groups, means = 2.15 and 2.08. Those with any CaC declined approximately 6% per hour in cortisol over the course of the day, whereas those with no CaC declined more than 8% per hour (p < .003). Those persons with slope scores in the flattest quartile had a greater likelihood of any CaC than did those in the remaining quartiles adjusted for sex-race group, age, smoking, treatment for diabetes, systolic blood pressure, logged triglycerides, average cortisol, and educational attainment (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% confidence interval = 1.26-5.30). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that HPA axis dysregulation may affect risk for atherosclerosis.

AB  - Nutrition usually makes a small but potentially valuable contribution to successful performance in elite athletes, and dietary supplements can make a minor contribution to this nutrition programme. Nonetheless, supplement use is widespread at all levels of sport. Products described as supplements target different issues, including (1) the management of micronutrient deficiencies, (2) supply of convenient forms of energy and macronutrients, and (3) provision of direct benefits to performance or (4) indirect benefits such as supporting intense training regimens. The appropriate use of some supplements can benefit the athlete, but others may harm the athlete's health, performance, and/or livelihood and reputation (if an antidoping rule violation results). A complete nutritional assessment should be undertaken before decisions regarding supplement use are made. Supplements claiming to directly or indirectly enhance performance are typically the largest group of products marketed to athletes, but only a few (including caffeine, creatine, specific buffering agents and nitrate) have good evidence of benefits. However, responses are affected by the scenario of use and may vary widely between individuals because of factors that include genetics, the microbiome and habitual diet. Supplements intended to enhance performance should be thoroughly trialled in training or simulated competition before being used in competition. Inadvertent ingestion of substances prohibited under the antidoping codes that govern elite sport is a known risk of taking some supplements. Protection of the athlete's health and awareness of the potential for harm must be paramount; expert professional opinion and assistance is strongly advised before an athlete embarks on supplement use.

AB  - The use of dietary supplements is widespread among athletes in all sports and at all levels of competition, as it is in the general population. For the athlete training at the limits of what is sustainable, or for those seeking a shortcut to achieving their aims, supplements offer the prospect of bridging the gap between success and failure. Surveys show, however, that this is often not an informed choice and that the knowledge level among consumers is often low and that they are often influenced in their decisions by individuals with an equally inadequate understanding of the issues at stake. Supplement use may do more harm than good, unless it is based on a sound analysis of the evidence. Where a deficiency of an essential nutrient has been established by appropriate investigations, supplementation can provide a rapid and effective correction of the problem. Supplements can also provide a convenient and time-efficient solution to achieving the necessary intake of key nutrients such as protein and carbohydrate. Athletes contemplating the use of supplements should consider the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Some ergogenic supplements may be of benefit to some athletes in some specific contexts, but many are less effective than is claimed. Some may be harmful to health of performance and some may contain agents prohibited by anti-doping regulations. Athletes should make informed choices that maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks.

AB  - Firefighters are occupationally exposed to products of combustion containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and flame retardants (FRs), potentially contributing to their increased risk for certain cancers. Personal protective equipment (PPE), including firefighter hoods, helps to reduce firefighters' exposure to toxic substances during fire responses by providing a layer of material on which contaminants deposit prior to reaching the firefighters skin. However, over time hoods that retain some contamination may actually contribute to firefighters' systemic dose. We investigated the effectiveness of laundering to reduce or remove contamination on the hoods, specifically PAHs and three classes of FRs: polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), non-PBDE flame retardants (NPBFRs), and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Participants in the study were grouped into crews of 12 firefighters who worked in pairs by job assignment while responding to controlled fires in a single-family residential structure. For each pair of firefighters, one hood was laundered after every scenario and one was not. Bulk samples of the routinely laundered and unlaundered hoods from five pairs of firefighters were collected and analyzed. Residual levels of OPFRs, NPBFRs, and PAHs were lower in the routinely laundered hoods, with total levels of each class of chemicals being 56-81% lower, on average, than the unlaundered hoods. PBDEs, on average, were 43% higher in the laundered hoods, most likely from cross contamination. After this initial testing, four of the five unlaundered exposed hoods were subsequently laundered with other heavily exposed (unlaundered) and unexposed (new) hoods. Post-laundering evaluation of these hoods revealed increased levels of PBDEs, NPBFRs, and OPFRs in both previously exposed and unexposed hoods, indicating cross contamination. For PAHs, there was little evidence of cross contamination and the exposed hoods were significantly less contaminated after laundering (76% reduction; p = 0.011). Further research is needed to understand how residual contamination on hoods could contribute to firefighters' systemic exposures.

AB  - Firefighters may encounter items containing flame retardants (FRs), including organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), during structure fires. This study utilized biological monitoring to characterize FR exposures in 36 firefighters assigned to interior, exterior, and overhaul job assignments, before and after responding to controlled residential fire scenarios. Firefighters provided four urine samples (pre-fire and 3-h, 6-h, and 12-h post-fire) and two serum samples (pre-fire and approximately 23-h post-fire). Urine samples were analyzed for OPFR metabolites, while serum samples were analyzed for PBDEs, brominated and chlorinated furans, and chlorinated dioxins. Urinary concentrations of diphenyl phosphate (DPhP), a metabolite of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), a metabolite of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEtP), a metabolite of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), increased from pre-fire to 3-hr and 6-hr post-fire collection, but only the DPhP increase was statistically significant at a 0.05 level. The 3-hr and 6-hr post-fire concentrations of DPhP and BDCPP, as well as the pre-fire concentration of BDCPP, were statistically significantly higher than general population levels. BDCPP pre-fire concentrations were statistically significantly higher in firefighters who previously participated in a scenario (within the past 12 days) than those who were responding to their first scenario as part of the study. Similarly, firefighters previously assigned to interior job assignments had higher pre-fire concentrations of BDCPP than those previously assigned to exterior job assignments. Pre-fire serum concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (23478-PeCDF), a known human carcinogen, were also statistically significantly above the general population levels. Of the PBDEs quantified, only decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) pre- and post-fire serum concentrations were statistically significantly higher than the general population. These results suggest firefighters absorbed certain FRs while responding to fire scenarios.

AB  - (291 words) The fire service has become more aware of the potential for adverse health outcomes due to occupational exposure to hazardous combustion byproducts. Because of these concerns, personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturers have developed new protection concepts like particulate-blocking hoods to reduce firefighters’ exposures. Additionally, fire departments have implemented exposure reduction interventions like routine laundering of PPE after fire responses. This study utilized a fireground exposure simulator (FES) with 24 firefighters performing firefighting activities on three consecutive days wearing one of three PPE ensembles (stratified by hood design and treatment of PPE): 1) new knit hood, new turnout jacket and new turnout pants 2) new particulate-blocking hood, new turnout jacket and new turnout pants or 3) laundered particulate-blocking hood, laundered turnout jacket and laundered turnout pants. As firefighters performed the firefighting activities, personal air sampling on the outside and inside the turnout jacket was conducted to quantify exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and naphthalene. Pre- and immediately post-fire exhaled breath samples were collected to characterize the absorption of VOCs. Benzene, toluene, and naphthalene were found to diffuse through and/or around the turnout jacket, as inside jacket benzene concentrations were often near levels reported outside the turnout jacket (9.7–11.7% median benzene reduction from outside the jacket to inside the jacket). The PPE ensemble did not appear to affect the level of contamination found inside the jacket for the compounds evaluated here. Benzene concentrations in exhaled breath increased significantly from pre to post-fire for all three groups (p-values < 0.05). The difference of pre-to post-fire benzene exhaled breath concentrations were positively associated with inside jacket and outside jacket benzene concentrations, even though self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) were worn during each response. This suggests the firefighters can absorb these compounds via the dermal route.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Firefighting is a dangerous occupation with a high incidence of low back pain and injury. Abnormal back muscle function and morphology has been linked to low back pain and poor physical performance. The effect of exercise training on back muscle size and symmetry has not been investigated in firefighters. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of worksite exercise training for eliciting lumbar multifidus muscle hypertrophy in firefighters. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with healthy, career firefighters (n=64) from a medium-sized fire department. Participants were randomized by fire station to exercise training (n=36) (supervised back and core exercise performed on duty, 2X/week, 24 weeks) or control (n=28). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the L4 and L5 lumbar multifidus muscle was assessed with ultrasonography at baseline and following the intervention. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, no significant differences were noted between the groups in the adjusted (by baseline scores and body mass) L4 and L5 lumbar multifidus muscle CSA and asymmetry values. CONCLUSIONS: A worksite exercise training program targeting the back and core is not effective for eliciting hypertrophy of the lumbar multifidus muscle in healthy firefighters.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Given the possible links between movement, fitness and injury, the goal of this study was to evaluate strength, endurance, and hip range of motion (ROM) (i.e. fitness); movement quality; and age in a population of firefighters. PARTICIPANTS: Male firefighters (n=282), all members of a major Canadian city fire department, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. METHODS: Torso endurance, grip strength, pull-ups, hip ROM, movement quality (sum of 7 movement tasks graded on a 0-3 scale), age, body mass, height, body mass index, and hip and waist circumference were assessed in 282 Firefighters. Relationships between variables were evaluated and compared to relevant populations (i.e. police officers, other firefighters, athletes, students and healthy males). RESULTS: There was no relationship between age and fitness or movement quality. Compared to other populations, our firefighter population had poorer torso endurance but similar grip strength. Larger body mass, waist circumference and hip width were correlated (p< 0.01) with poorer Total Movement Score. Back extensor endurance (Biering-Sorensen test) was found to have the strongest relationship with Total Movement Score in comparison to all other tests. Notably, the extensor endurance and pull-ups were related to five of nine tasks each. The magnitude of hip ROM asymmetry related only to the stand-sit-stand movement test. In general, correlations between variables were relatively low, suggesting that most of these variables are independent and/or unrelated to one another. CONCLUSIONS: Movement quality is not strongly correlated with traditionally utilized markers of fitness, nor is movement linked to age. This would imply that training should include movement competency components together with traditional fitness objectives.

AB  - This project investigated whey protein and/or carbohydrate supplementation effects on musculoskeletal injury (MSI) outcomes. Four groups of Initial Entry Training soldiers consumed either: (1) one protein (38.6 g, 293 kcal); (2) one carbohydrate (63.4 g, 291 kcal); (3) two protein (77.2 g, 586 kcal); or (4) two carbohydrate servings/day (126.8 g, 582 kcal) after physical training and before bed, or before bed only. Odds Ratio, Chi-square and Wilcoxon ranked-sum test compared supplementation/no supplementation, number of servings, and protein/carbohydrate for MSI and limited/missed duty rates and limited/missed training days. Non-matched pairs group averages were compared to 2015/2016 historical data. Non-supplemented soldiers were approximately 5x more likely to sustain a MSI (chi2 = 58.48, p < 0.001) and 4x more likely to miss training (chi2 = 9.73, p = 0.003) compared to two servings. Non-supplemented soldiers missed five additional training days compared to two servings (W = 6059.5, p = 0.02). Soldiers consuming one serving were approximately 3x more likely to sustain a MSI than two servings (chi2 = 9.55, p = 0.002). There was no difference in limited/missed duty rates or limited/missed training days between consuming one or two servings. There was no difference between consuming one serving versus no supplementation or protein versus carbohydrate supplementation for any outcome variable. Soldiers consuming 2 servings/day of protein or carbohydrate had lower MSI rates, limited/missed duty rates, and limited/ missed training days compared to non-supplemented soldiers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular capacity declines with aging, as evidenced by declining maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max ), with little known about the specific mechanisms of this decline. Our study objective was to assess the effect of a 30-year interval on body composition and cardiovascular response to acute exercise in 5 healthy subjects originally evaluated in 1966. METHODS AND RESULTS: Anthropometric parameters and the cardiovascular response to acute maximal exercise were assessed with noninvasive techniques. On average, body weight increased 25% (77 versus 100 kg) and percent body fat increased 100% (14% versus 28%), with little change in fat-free mass (66 versus 72 kg). On average, VO(2)max decreased 11% (3.30 versus 2.90 L/min). Likewise, VO(2)max decreased when indexed to total body mass (43 versus 31 mL. kg(-1). min(-1)) or fat-free mass (50 versus 43 mL/kg fat-free mass per minute). Maximal heart rate declined 6% (193 versus 181 bpm) and maximal stroke volume increased 16% (104 versus 121 mL), with no difference observed in maximal cardiac output (20.0 versus 21.4 L/min). Maximal AV oxygen difference declined 15% (16.2 versus 13.8 vol%) and accounted for the entire decrease in cardiovascular capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular capacity declined over the 30-year study interval in these 5 middle-aged men primarily because of an impaired efficiency of maximal peripheral oxygen extraction. Maximal cardiac output was maintained with a decline in maximal heart rate compensated for by an increased maximal stroke volume. Most notably, 3 weeks of bedrest in these same men at 20 years of age (1966) had a more profound impact on physical work capacity than did 3 decades of aging.

RN  - Comparison between douglas bags and COSMED K4b2. Examined 4 parameters, on consecutive days at similar times of day in 10 healthy males. Oxygen consumption (V02), Carbon dioxide production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE) and respiratory exchange ratio (R). Data were collected during the last 2 minutes of 5 minute trials and averaged. Data were averaged because Douglas bags cannot make instantaneous measurements. Trials done at rest, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250W power output on ergometer (Monark 818E). Have reference indicating that 3-4% day to day variation in all parameters was expected.

AB  - Burnout syndrome, comprised of the symptoms of emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness, is believed to be a result of ineffective coping with enduring stress. This study of 111 nonshift blue-collar workers free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) examined whether chronic burnout is associated with a state of somatic and physiological hyperarousal. Results showed that 37 workers exhibited symptoms of chronic burnout, with symptoms lasting at least 6 months. These workers, compared to those with no burnout symptoms (n = 52) or nonchronic burnout symptoms (n = 22), had higher levels of tension at work, postwork irritability, more sleep disturbances and complaints of waking up exhausted, and higher cortisol levels during the work day. These results suggest that chronic burnout is associated with heightened somatic arousal and elevated salivary cortisol levels. This may be part of the mechanism underlying the emerging association between burnout and risk of CVD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chemical widely used in food and drinks packaging. Associations have previously been reported between urinary BPA concentrations and heart disease, diabetes and liver enzymes in adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/04. We aimed to estimate associations between urinary BPA concentrations and health measures in NHANES 2005/06 and in data pooled across collection years. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES: subjects were n = 1455 (2003/04) and n = 1493 (2005/06) adults aged 18-74 years, representative of the general adult population of the United States. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine concentration. Main outcomes were reported diagnoses of heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina and diabetes and serum liver enzyme levels. Urinary BPA concentrations in 2005/06 (geometric mean 1.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) were lower than in 2003/04 (2.49 ng/ml, CI: 2.20 to 2.83, difference p-value = 0.00002). Higher BPA concentrations were associated with coronary heart disease in 2005/06 (OR per z-score increase in BPA = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) and in pooled data (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.17 to 1.72, p = 0.001). Associations with diabetes did not reach significance in 2005/06, but pooled estimates remained significant (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40, p = 0.001). There was no overall association with gamma glutamyl transferase concentrations, but pooled associations with alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, is consistently associated with reported heart disease in the general adult population of the USA. Studies to clarify the mechanisms of these associations are urgently needed.

AB  - KEY POINTS: Muscle fibre cross sectional area is enhanced with massage in the form of cyclic compressive loading during regrowth after atrophy. Massage enhances protein synthesis of the myofibrillar and cytosolic, but not the mitochondrial fraction, in muscle during regrowth. Focal adhesion kinase activation and satellite cell number are elevated in muscles undergoing massage during regrowth. Muscle fibre cross sectional area and protein synthesis of the myofibrillar fraction, but not DNA synthesis, are elevated in muscle of the contralateral non-massaged limb. Massage in the form of cyclic compressive loading is a potential anabolic intervention during muscle regrowth after atrophy. ABSTRACT: Massage, in the form of cyclic compressive loading (CCL), is associated with multiple health benefits, but its potential anabolic effect on atrophied muscle has not been investigated. We hypothesized that the mechanical activity associated with CCL induces an anabolic effect in skeletal muscle undergoing regrowth after a period of atrophy. Fischer-Brown Norway rats at 10 months of age were hindlimb unloaded for a period of 2 weeks. The rats were then allowed reambulation with CCL applied at a 4.5 N load at 0.5 Hz frequency for 30 min every other day for four bouts during a regrowth period of 8 days. Muscle fibre cross sectional area was enhanced by 18% with massage during regrowth compared to reloading alone, and this was accompanied by elevated myofibrillar and cytosolic protein as well as DNA synthesis. Focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation indicated that CCL increased mechanical stimulation, while a higher number of Pax7(+) cells likely explains the elevated DNA synthesis. Surprisingly, the contralateral non-massaged limb exhibited a comparable 17% higher muscle fibre size compared to reloading alone, and myofibrillar protein synthesis, but not DNA synthesis, was also elevated. We conclude that massage in the form of CCL induces an anabolic response in muscles regrowing after an atrophy-inducing event. We suggest that massage can be used as an intervention to aid in the regrowth of muscle lost during immobilization.

AB  - Abstract The nutritional regulation of protein and amino acid balance in human skeletal muscle carried out by the authors with Mike Rennie is reviewed in the context of a simple physiological model for the regulation of the maintenance and growth of skeletal muscle, the “Bag Theory.” Beginning in London in the late 1970s the work has involved the use of stable isotopes to probe muscle protein synthesis and breakdown with two basic experimental models, primed-dose continuous tracer infusions combined with muscle biopsies and arterio-venous (A-V) studies across a limb, most often the leg, allowing both protein synthesis and breakdown as well as net balance to be measured. In this way, over a 30y period, the way in which amino acids and insulin mediated the anabolic effect of a meal has been elaborated in great detail confirming the original concepts of bag filling within the muscle endomysial “bag,” which is limited by the “bag” size, unless bag enlargement occurs, which requires new collagen synthesis. Finally we briefly review some new developments involving 2H2O labelling of muscle proteins. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

AB  - We have reported that the acute postexercise increases in muscle protein synthesis rates, with differing nutritional support, are predictive of longer-term training-induced muscle hypertrophy. Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen men (21 ± 1 yr, 22.6 ± 2.1 kg/m(2); means ± SE) had their legs randomly assigned to two of three training conditions that differed in contraction intensity [% of maximal strength (1 repetition maximum)] or contraction volume (1 or 3 sets of repetitions): 30%-3, 80%-1, and 80%-3. Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant (P < 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30%-3 = 6.8 ± 1.8%, 80%-1 = 3.2 ± 0.8%, and 80%-3= 7.2 ± 1.9%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80%-1 and 80%-3, but were greater than 30%-3 (P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions (P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation (P < 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80%-1 and 80%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy. In accordance with our previous acute measurements of muscle protein synthetic rates a lower load lifted to failure resulted in similar hypertrophy as a heavy load lifted to failure.

AB  -: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hot (37 degrees C) and cool (10 degrees C) environments on cycling time-to-exhaustion (TTE), pH, lactate, and core temperature (Tc). Eleven endurance-trained subjects completed four TTE trials: Hot, 80% VO2max (H80); Cool 80% (C80); Hot 100% (H100); and Cool 100% VO2max (C100). Esophageal temperature and blood was sampled before, every 5 min, at exhaustion, and 3 min post-exercise and analyzed for lactate, pH, and HCO3. Multifactorial ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine differences between means (+/-SD). TTE was shorter in H100 and C100 vs. H80 and C80 (5.64+/-1.49, 5.83+/-1.03, 12.82+/-2.0, and 24.85+/-6.0 min, respectively), and shorter in H80 vs. C80 (p < 0.01). pH at exhaustion was different among all conditions (7.17+/-0.06, 7.15+/-0.07, 7.21+/-0.04, and 7.24+/-0.06 units for H100, C100, H80, and C80, respectively, p = 0.02). Tc at exhaustion was lower in H100 and C100 (37.93+/-0.67 and 37.62+/-0.58o C) vs. H80 and C80 (38.54+/-0.51 and 38.53+/-0.38o C) (p < 0.01). In H80 and C80 the higher Tc likely played a greater role in the termination of exercise; whereas, in H100 and C100, pH and metabolic changes may have been more important. Despite these differences, neither an upper limit for Tc, nor a lower limit for pH was identified; thus, fatigue based entirely on peripheral factors was not supported, and a combination of peripheral and central processes must be considered. The practical implications of these findings are that aerobic exercise at or near VO2max may be impacted more by metabolic factors, while lower intensities (approx. 80% Vo2max) may be affected more by heat stress; these differences should be considered when training for events of this type.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite anecdotal evidence suggesting that heavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, there have been no controlled studies of the risk of myocardial infarction during and after heavy exertion, the length of time between heavy exertion and the onset of symptoms (induction time), and whether the risk can be modified by regular physical exertion. To address these questions, we collected data from patients with confirmed myocardial infarction on their activities one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction and during control periods. METHODS: Interviews with 1228 patients conducted an average of four days after myocardial infarction provided data on their usual annual frequency of physical activity and the time, type, and intensity of physical exertion in the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. We compared the observed frequency of heavy exertion (6 or more metabolic equivalents) with the expected values using two types of self-matched analyses based on a new case-crossover study design. The low frequency of heavy exertion during the control periods was validated by data from a population-based control group of 218 subjects. RESULTS: Of the patients, 4.4 percent reported heavy exertion within one hour before the onset of myocardial infarction. The estimated relative risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after heavy physical exertion, as compared with less strenuous physical exertion or none, was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.7), Among people who usually exercised less than one, one to two, three to four, or five or more times per week, the respective relative risks were 107 (95 percent confidence interval, 67 to 171), 19.4 (9.9 to 38.1), 8.6 (3.6 to 20.5), and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7). Thus, increasing levels of habitual physical activity were associated with progressively lower relative risks. The induction time from heavy exertion to the onset of myocardial infarction was less than one hour, and symptoms usually began during the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy physical exertion can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in people who are habitually sedentary. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which heavy physical exertion triggers the onset of myocardial infarction and the manner in which regular exertion protects against it would facilitate the design of new preventive approaches.

RN  - Used eye tracking software to determine the locations of gaze fixation ascending and descending stair. Found that focus tended to be near middle stairs, and that gaze fixations didn’t change with increasing familiarity on the stairs. Stated that other studies have looked at head and eye location by observation, but this is inaccurate.

AB  - Evidence for the effectiveness of the enrichment of food products with n-3 fatty acids by inclusion of either plant- or fish-derived materials in the diets of chickens, turkeys, ostriches, cows, pigs, and goats has been reviewed. Both linseed oil/meal and fish products can increase the levels of total n-3 fatty acids in animal products, including milk, eggs, meat, and deli products. The extent of this increase in n-3 fatty acid contents seems to be dependent on the nature of diet supplementation. Encapsulation of linseed oil may result in higher milk cow ALA contents, as compared to unprotected linseed oil. Available literature indicates that the levels of EPA and DHA in food products may be increased more, if the animals' diet was supplemented with fish products rather than linseed products. However, organoleptic properties of food products may be compromised. This pitfall may be reduced by the addition of antioxidants and/or application of micro-encapsulation. Generation of transgenic animals and plants has shown very promising results. Thus far, transgenic pigs and mice have been successfully generated. These animals have a low ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids in their tissues and milk. The advantages and disadvantages of the above-mentioned methods have been discussed. The evidence for health-promoting effects of such enriched food products has been included.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Percent of predicted peak VO(2) (ppVO(2)) is considered a standard measure for establishing disease severity, however, there are known limitations to traditional normative values. This study sought to compare ppVO(2) from the newly derived "Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: a National Database" (FRIEND) registry equation to conventional prediction equations in a clinical cohort of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 1094 patients referred for evaluation of heart failure (HF) symptoms who underwent CPX. ppVO(2) was calculated using the FRIEND, Wasserman/Hansen and Jones equations. Participants were followed for a median of 4.5 years [Interquartile range 3.5-6.0] for the composite endpoint of death, advanced HF therapy, or acute decompensated HF requiring hospital admission. Mean age was 48 ± 15 years and 62% were female. The FRIEND registry equation predicted the lowest ppVO(2) (measured/predicted; 71 ± 31%), compared to the Wasserman/Hansen (74 ± 29%) and Jones equations (83 ± 33%) (p < 0.001). All expressions of peak VO(2) were significant as univariate predictors of outcome with no significant differences between equations on pairwise analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves. When compared at a similar threshold of ppVO(2) the event rate was significantly lower in the FRIEND registry equation versus the currently used Wasserman and Jones equations. CONCLUSION: The use of the newly derived FRIEND registry equation predicts HF outcomes; however, it appears to predict a higher predicted VO(2); the clinical implication being a lower threshold of percent predicted peak VO(2) should be considered when risk stratifying patients with HF.

AB  - To validate V̇o 2 and energy expenditure predictions by the Suunto heart rate (HR) system against a first principle gas analysis system, well-trained male (n =10, age 29.8 ±4.3 years, V̇o 2 65.9 ± 9.7 ml-kg -1 min -1 and female (n = 7, 25.6 ±3.6 years, 57.0 ±4.2 ml-kg -1-min -1) runners completed a 2-stage incremental running test to establish submaximal and maximal oxygen uptake values. Metabolic cart values were used as the criterion measure of V̇o 2 and energy expenditure (kJ) and compared with the predicted values from the Suunto software. The 3 levels of software analysis for the Suunto system were basic personal information (BI), BI + measured maximal HR (BI hr), and BI hr) + measured V̇o 2) (BI hr+v). Comparisons were analyzed using linear regression to determine the standard error of the estimate (SEE). Eight subjects repeated the trial within 7 days to determine reliability (typical error [TE]). The SEEs for oxygen consumption via BI, BI hr), and BI hr+v) were 2.6, 2.8, and 2.6 ml-kg -1 min -1, respectively, with corresponding percent coefficient of variation (%CV) of 6.0, 6.5, and 6.0. The bias compared with the criterion V̇o 2 decreased from "6.3 for BI, "2.5 for BI hr, to "0.9% for BI hr+v. The SEE of energy expenditure improved from BI (6.74 kJ) to BI hr (6.56) and BI hr+v (6.14) with corresponding %CV of 13.6, 12.2, and 12.7. The TE values for V̇O 2 were -0.60 ml-kg- -1 min -1 and -2 kJ for energy expenditure. The %CV for Vo2 and energy expenditure was -1 to 4%. Although reliable, basic HR-based estimations of V̇O 2 and energy expenditure from the Suunto system underestimated V̇O 2 and energy expenditure by -6 and 13%, respectively. However, estimation can be improved when maximal HR and V̇O 2 values are added to the software analysis. ©2009 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

AB  - Psychological stress has been linked empirically with dysregulation of facets of the human immune system, yet these effects are not the same in every situation or population. Recent research has made strides towards understanding risk factors for immune dysregulation as well as why these risks occur. This review discusses mechanisms and mediators underlying the stress-immune relation, the role of context in determining whether an immunologic responses to stress is adaptive versus maladaptive, and the stress-immune relation in populations including children exposed to early adversity, older adults, and individuals with clinical diagnoses. The reviewed work holds great promise for further elucidating the circumstances under which psychological stress has immunological consequences, and provides new directions for work in this field.

AB  - The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of trait anxiety in predicting respiratory distress resulting from heavy physical work performed while wearing an industrial respirator. Spielberger's trait anxiety scale was administered to 45 male volunteers in order to identify individuals with elevated trait anxiety. This testing was followed by a pulmonary function test, resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and an exercise ECG. Individuals with cardiovascular and/or pulmonary impairment did not continue with subsequent tests. The subjects next completed three treadmill tasks varying in intensity from 35% to 80% of VO2max, and each trial lasted for 10 minutes. Twenty-five of these individuals performed the exercise tasks while wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the demand mode, whereas the remaining 20 subjects used a pressure-demand SCBA. The reason for terminating exercise was classified as respiratory or non-respiratory on the basis of self-report responses on a 7-point dyspnea scale, as well as general responses concerning muscular fatigue and respiration. It was predicted, based upon trait anxiety scores, that six individuals would have respiratory distress, and five (83%) of these predictions were correct. It was also predicted that 39 of the 45 subjects would not experience distress and 38 (97%) of these predictions were correct. It was concluded that objective measures of trait anxiety can be used to identify those individuals who are most likely to experience distress while wearing an industrial respirator and performing heavy physical exercise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mark 3 (M3) water power pump is an integral piece of wildfire fighting equipment. However, it is provided to fire stations without a carrying harness. The currently-used carrying harness is very uncomfortable, especially when carrying the pumps considerable distance in a forest to reach a water source. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to advise the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources on the selection of a new M3 load carriage system. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty Fire Rangers wore the three systems (Original, Prototype, and Modified) through a circuit of tasks representative of their working environment. METHODS: Subjective and objective approaches were combined to assess and rank the M3 carriage systems. Subjective visual analogue scale ratings were obtained for ease of loading/unloading, comfort, system stability, and overall performance. Tri-axial accelerometers were mounted on each pump and at the sternum of each participant to determine relative pump-carrier accelerations. RESULTS: Overall, the Prototype was ranked as the best system; it resulted in the lowest relative pump-carrier accelerations on 10 out of 15 objective measures, and also received a first place ranking on all subjective measures. CONCLUSION: It was recommended that the Prototype be implemented as the M3 carriage system for fire suppression teams.

AB  - Neurological disability and walking impairment are two common, co-varying consequences of multiple sclerosis (MS) that can result in substantial patient burden for daily activities and quality of life. Indeed, neurological disability and walking impairment are driven by pathological changes in the central nervous system, and measurement of walking function is a common method of monitoring the progression of disease and neurological disability. The existing data indicate that the presence of walking impairments range from performance through real-world outcomes based on comparison of MS versus healthy controls, and walking impairments become worse with increasing severity of neurological disability (i.e., progression). Accordingly, researchers and clinicians have considered both pharmaceutical and rehabilitation approaches for managing walking impairment in MS. Both approaches yield beneficial effects on walking outcomes, although the majority of research has focused on exercise training rather than pharmaceutical interventions. Overall, this underscores the importance of continued efforts toward identifying approaches for preventing, forestalling and restoring walking function in persons with MS across the spectrum of neurological disability and its progression.

AB  - AbstractObjective To determine which work-related injuries are the most frequent and costly. Design Secondary analysis of workers' compensation claims data. Setting Data were provided by a large, Maryland workers' compensation insurer from 1998 through 2008. Participants Not applicable. Interventions None. Main Outcomes Measures For 45 injury types, the number of claims and compensation amount was calculated for total compensation and for medical and indemnity compensation separately. Results Back and knee injuries were the most frequently occurring single injury types, whereas heart attack and occupational disease were the most expensive in terms of mean compensation. When taking into account both the frequency and cost of injury (mean cost × number occurrences), back, knee, and shoulder injuries were the most expensive single injury types. Conclusions Successful prevention and management of back, knee, and shoulder injuries could lead to a substantial reduction in the burden associated with work-related injuries.

AB  - Firefighter turnout gear is essential for reducing occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals during training and fire events. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are observed in firefighter serum, and possible occupational sources include the air and dust of fires, aqueous film-forming foam, and turnout gear. Limited data exist for nonvolatile and volatile PFASs on firefighter turnout gear and the disposition of fluorine on the individual layers of turnout gear. Further implications for exposure to fluorine on turnout gear are not well understood. Three unused turnout garments purchased in 2019 and one purchased in 2008, were analyzed for 50 nonvolatile and 15 volatile PFASs by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-qTOF-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), respectively. Particle-induced gamma ray emission (PIGE), a surface technique, and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), a bulk technique, were used to measure total fluorine. Bulk characterization of the layers by pyrolysis-GC/MS (py-GC/MS) was used to differentiate fluoropolymer (e.g., PTFE) films from textile layers finished with side-chain polymers. The outer layer, moisture barrier, and thermal layers of the turnout gear all yielded measured concentrations of volatile PFASs that exceeded nonvolatile PFAS concentrations, but the summed molar concentrations made up only a small fraction of total fluorine (0.0016–6.7%). Moisture barrier layers comprised a PTFE film, as determined by py-GC–MS, and gave the highest individual nonvolatile (0.159 mg F/kg) and volatile PFAS (20.7 mg F/kg) as well as total fluorine (122,000 mg F/kg) concentrations. Outer and thermal layers comprised aromatic polyamide-based fibers (aramid) treated with side-chain fluoropolymers and had lower levels of individual nonvolatile and volatile PFASs. Equal concentrations of total fluorine by both PIGE and INAA on the outer and thermal layers is consistent with treatment with a side-chain fluoropolymer coating. New turnout gear should be examined as a potential source of firefighter occupational exposure to nonvolatile and volatile PFASs in future assessments.

RN  - Presents a new normalized method for finding foot placement and clearance. Foot placement was defined as the horizontal distance from the big-toe marker to the step edge marker, normalized to percent of foot length (heel marker to toe marker). Foot clearance was defined as the square root of ΔX2+ΔZ2, where ΔX znd ΔZ are the horizontal and vertical distance between the heel marker and step edge. Foot clearance was divided into landing and passing clearance. Landing clearance was clearance when the foot landed on the step directly after the edge. Passing clearance was clearance of the foot over the edge of the step it was not landing on.

AB  - The aim of this study was to simultaneously assess the changes in physiology, and kinematic and spatiotemporal features of gait, during prolonged load carriage in individuals without load carriage experience. Eleven males, representative of new military recruits, walked for 120 min at 5.5 km h(- 1), 0% grade, on a motorised treadmill while carrying a 22 kg load. The load ( </= 30% body mass) was distributed over a weighted vest, combat webbing and replica model firearm, to reflect a patrol order load. Oxygen consumption and heart rate increased throughout the trial; however, apart from a minor increase in step length, there were no changes in the kinematic or spatiotemporal parameters, despite an increase in perceived exertion and discomfort. These data suggest that individuals with no experience in load carriage are able to maintain normal gait during 2 h of fixed speed walking, while carrying a patrol order load </= 30% body mass.

AB  - Plasma free amino acid (PFAA) concentrations in humans are affected by various diseases. However, the variations caused are not dramatic, so a high accurate and precise method for analyzing PFAAs is required. The PFAA analysis protocol described in this chapter covers blood sampling, sample pretreatment, amino acid derivatization, and LC-MS analysis. Each procedure is important for accurate and precise quantification.In the protocol, a human blood sample is collected using an EDTA-2Na or 2K vacuum collection tube and then immediately cooled in water mixed with crushed ice. The sample is then centrifuged on cooling to allow a plasma sample to be removed. A stable-isotope-labeled internal standard solution is added to the plasma, and then the plasma is deproteinized with acetonitrile. The amino acids in the plasma are then derivatized using 3-aminopyridyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (APDS) reagent which is designed for LC-MS analysis. The derivatized amino acids are separated by reverse-phase HPLC and detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Using this method, 21 amino acids in human plasma can be analyzed with a 12 min cycle. The accuracy and precision are both better than the required criteria given by the US Food and Drug Administration in guidance of Bioanalytical Method Validation.

AB  - Body sway variables (sway area and sway path) were recorded by a dynamometric platform in 13 young subjects, standing quiet with feet together, with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), prior to and following two types of physical exercise (treadmill walking and cycle ergometer pedalling). Each exercise was performed under both fatiguing (above anaerobic threshold) and non-fatiguing conditions. Following fatiguing treadmill exercise, we observed a significant increase in body sway with respect to pre-exercise values. The increase was present under both visual conditions, affected both sway area and sway path and lasted until about 15 min from the end of the exercise. The Romberg quotient (the ratio of EC/EO of sway area, or sway path) significantly increased after the fatiguing exercise with respect to the non-fatiguing exercise. The mean position of the centre of foot pressure (CFP) was unchanged after the exercise. Fatigue induced an increase in the median frequency of oscillation of the centre of foot pressure, independent of the amplitude of sway. Non-fatiguing treadmill exercise induced no significant changes in sway or in its frequency content. Following fatiguing cycle ergometer exercise, a negligible increase or a decrease (under eyes closed condition) in body sway were observed. Non-fatiguing cycling exercise induced no significant changes or a decrease in sway. Control experiments showed that simple repetition of successive stance trials (without intercalated exercise) was able by itself to induce a decrease in sway. By taking this effect into account, both types of cycling exercises revealed a mild capacity to increase sway. We concluded that body sway increased after strenuous physical exercise, but was little affected by exercise performed below the estimated anaerobic threshold. The effects of fatigue on sway were short-lasting and of moderate extent, and therefore were not liable to seriously threaten body equilibrium.

AB  - Wildfires in America are becoming larger, more frequent, and more destructive, driven by climate change and existing land management practices. Many of these fires occur at the wildland-urban interface (WUI), areas where development and wildland areas overlap and which are increasingly at risk of devastating fires as communities continue to expand into previously undeveloped areas. Unlike conventional wildfires, WUI fires are driven in part by burning of homes, cars, and other human-made structures, and in part by burning vegetation. The interaction of these two types of fires can lead to public health effects that are unique to WUI fires. This report evaluates existing and needed chemistry information that decision-makers can use to mitigate WUI fires and their potential health impacts. It describes key fuels of concern in WUI fires, especially household components like siding, insulation, and plastic, examines key pathways for exposure, including inhalation and ingestion, and identifies communities vulnerable to exposures. The report recommends a research agenda to inform response to and prevention of WUI fires, outlining needs in characterizing fuels, and predicting emissions and toxicants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Firefighters have high rate of injuries and illnesses, as well as exposures to high levels of noise. This study explored the relationship between noise exposure and injury among firefighters. METHODS: We recruited firefighters undergoing vehicle extrication and structural collapse emergency response training at a highly realistic training facility. Demographics, health status, body mass index (BMI), and history of serious injuries (i.e. injuries requiring first aid treatment, treatment in a medical clinic or office, or treatment at a hospital) were assessed at baseline, and daily activities, injury events, and near misses were assessed daily via surveys. Participants' noise exposures were monitored for one 24-h period using noise dosimeters. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate the odds of injury events and near misses associated with noise exposure as an independent variable. RESULTS: Of 56 subjects, 20 (36%) reported that they had ever suffered a serious injury during firefighting activities, and 9 (16%) reported a serious injury within the past year. We estimated rates of 6.6 lifetime serious injuries per 100 FTE 16.1 serious injuries per 100 FTE within the past year. Our models indicated a significant increase in injury events and near misses among those with higher BMI, and as well as a dose-response relationship between near misses/injuries and increasing noise levels. Noise levels >90 dBA in the 30 min prior to time of injury or near miss were associated with substantially increased odds ratios for injury or near miss. Our models further indicated that perceived job demands were significantly associated with increased risk of injury or near miss. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that noise exposures may need to be incorporated into injury prevention programs for firefighters to reduce injuries among this high-risk occupational group.

AB  - Results are presented from a series of small-scale wind tunnel experiments to improve understanding how embers accumulate on isolated building rooftops. Non-combusting model embers were introduced into a wind tunnel and the embers that stayed on the roof were collected and weighed. The results indicate that only a small fraction of embers (typically less than 10%) remain in contact with a building rooftop compared to the mass that would have fallen on the building footprint were the building not there. Embers landed at a broad range of locations on the model rooftops. Some of those that landed did not remain in contact with the rooftop but were blown off. The vast majority that did stay on the roof moved from their landing location to the rooftop internal corners where they came to rest. The accumulation rates measured were very sensitive to the building shape and wind angle as both these parameters control the flow separation over and around the building that in turn controls the ember's path and stability. Tests run for the same geometry at different wind speeds indicate that there is a critical wind speed above which embers will no longer accumulate on the roof top.

AB  - Key points Chronic inflammation underlies many of the health decrements associated with obesity. Circulating progenitor cells can sense and respond to inflammatory stimuli, increasing the local inflammatory response within tissues. Here we show that 6 weeks of endurance exercise training significantly decreases inflammatory circulating progenitor cells in obese adults. These findings provide novel cellular mechanisms for the beneficial effects of exercise in obese adults. Abstract Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) and subpopulations are normally found in the bone marrow, but can migrate to peripheral tissues to participate in local inflammation and/or remodelling. The purpose of this study was to compare the CPC response, particularly the inflammatory-primed haematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) subpopulation, to a 6 week endurance exercise training (EET) intervention between lean and obese adults. Seventeen healthy weight (age: 23.9 ± 5.4 years, body mass index (BMI): 22.0 ± 2.6 kg m−2) and 10 obese (age: 29.0 ± 8.0 years, BMI: 33.1 ± 6.0 kg m−2) previously sedentary adults participated in an EET. Blood was collected before and after EET for quantification of CPCs and subpopulations via flow cytometry, colony forming unit assays and plasma concentrations of C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). Exercise training reduced the number of circulating HSPCs and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs). EET increased the colony forming potential of granulocytes and macrophages irrespective of BMI. EET reduced the number of HSPCs expressing the chemokine receptor CCR2 and the pro-inflammatory marker TLR4. EET-induced changes in adipose tissue-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs were negatively related to changes in absolute fitness. Our results indicate that EET, regardless of BMI status, decreases CPCs and subpopulations, particularly those primed for contribution to tissue inflammation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Circulating progenitor cells (CPC) are a heterogeneous population of stem/progenitor cells in peripheral blood that participate in tissue repair. CPC mobilization has been well characterized in able-bodied persons but has not been previously investigated in wheelchair racing athletes. The purpose of this study was to characterize CPC and CPC subpopulation mobilization in elite wheelchair racing athletes in response to acute, upper-extremity aerobic exercise to determine whether CPC responses are similar to ambulatory populations. METHODS: Eight participants (three females; age = 27.5 +/- 4.0 yr, supine height = 162.5 +/- 18.6 cm, weight = 53.5 +/- 10.9 kg, V O2peak = 2.4 +/- 0.62 L.min, years postinjury = 21.5 +/- 6.2 yr) completed a 25-km time trial on a road course. Blood sampling occurred before and immediately after exercise for quantification of CPC (CD34), hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) (CD34/CD45), hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (CD34/CD45/CD38), CD34 adipose tissue (AT)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) (CD45/CD34/CD105/CD31), CD34 bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC (CD45/CD34/CD105/CD31), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) (CD45/CD34/VEGFR2) via flow cytometry. Blood lactate was measured before and after trial as an indicator of exercise intensity. RESULTS: CPC concentration increased 5.7-fold postexercise (P = 0.10). HSPC, HSC, EPC, and both MSC populations were not increased postexercise. Baseline HSPC populations were significantly positively correlated to absolute V O2peak (rho = 0.71, P < 0.05) with HSC trending to positively correlate to V O2peak (rho = 0.62, P = 0.10). AT-MSC populations were trending to be negatively correlated to baseline V O2peak (rho = -0.62, P = 0.058). The change in CPC, EPC, and AT-MSC pre- and postexercise significantly positively correlated to the change in lactate concentrations (rho = 0.91 P = 0.002, 0.71 P = 0.047, 0.81 P = 0.02, respectively, all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CPC content in wheelchair racing athletes is related to cardiorespiratory fitness, and responses to exercise are positively related to exercise intensity.

AB  - Diets currently used to produce atherosclerotic lesions in mice are often undefined and cause accumulation of fat in the liver and gallstone formation. Therefore, synthetic low and high fat diets of known composition were formulated in this study. A synthetic diet containing 50% sucrose, 15% cocoa butter, 1% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate was found to produce a depression in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and an elevation of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the atherosclerosis-susceptible strain, C57BL/6J. This diet was able to consistently produce aortic lesions and led to a decrease in liver damage and gallstone formation. The synthetic low fat diet did not produce HDL-C levels as high as those found in mice fed chow, but resulted in similar VLDL/LDL-C levels. Lipoprotein and apolipoprotein parameters were compared in C57BL/6J and the atherosclerosis-resistant strain, C3H/HeJ, consuming the synthetic low fat or high fat diets. As reported earlier, when consuming a high fat diet C57BL/6J mice have significantly lower HDL-C and apoA-I levels than C3H/HeJ mice. Further analysis shows that the molar ratio of plasma HDL-C to apoA-I is significantly lower in C57BL/6J mice, suggesting that HDL in the susceptible strain has a lower cholesterol-carrying capacity. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the HDL particle size is smaller for C57BL/6J mice than for C3H/HeJ. Both strains increased their apoE levels when fed the synthetic high fat diet, but C3H/HeJ mice had higher levels of apoE on both diets. The major response to consumption of the high fat diet for both strains was an increase in apoB-48 from 5 micrograms/ml on a low fat diet to 54 and 109 micrograms/ml for C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ, respectively. ApoB-100 showed minimal response to the high fat diet. The defined high fat diet can be used to study atherosclerosis in the mouse since it produces aortic lesions but reduces or eliminates other pathological changes such as gallstone formation and liver damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gait impairment is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but there is a lack of evidence about gait performance in the group of MS patients with no apparent disability. The aim of our study was to evaluate gait characteristics in MS patients with no apparent impairment of walking and with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS 0-1.5), and to determine whether any abnormalities are detectable by common clinical tests. METHODS: This was an observational study of 64 MS patients with an EDSS 0-1.5 and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We measured their performance in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FWT) and the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). The spatiotemporal parameters of gait were measured using a GAITRite instrument. RESULTS: MS patients with no apparent disability (EDSS 0-1.5) performed worse in T25FWT and 2MWT than normal controls. During the self-selected walking speed test on GAITRite, MS patients had a prolonged double support phase, and during the fast walking speed test, they had lower cadence and decreased step length.

AB  - Introduction: Optimal diet together with good physical fitness maintains readiness and military performance during longer deployments. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in dietary macronutrient and energy intake, total physical activity and body composition during a 6-month deployment in South Lebanon. Furthermore, associations of diet macronutrient intake and physical activity on body composition were also studied. Materials and Methods: Forty male soldiers kept a 3-day food diary and their body composition was measured via bioimpedance and ultrasonography. Total physical activity was evaluated by accelerometers in a subgroup of participants. Measurements were conducted in the PRE-, MID-, and POST-deployment. Results: Mean carbohydrate intakes were 39.5-42.6 E%, protein intakes 18.7-22.3 E%, and fat intakes 34.9-35.7 E%. Daily energy intake remained stable (10.1-10.3 MJ/D). Total physical activity was decreased during deployment (e.g., step count from 9,835 +/- 2,743 to 8,388 +/- 2,875 steps/day, p = 0.007). Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased by 1.3% (p = 0.019) and 1.9% (p = 0.006), respectively. Energy and fat intake associated positively with body mass and skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.31-0.48, p < 0.05-0.001). Conclusions: Carbohydrate intakes and physical activity were low, compared with the general recommendations. Protein intakes were relatively high. Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased. Suboptimal diet together with low level of physical activity may have a negative impact on body composition, physical performance, and cardiometabolic health. Consequently, soldiers should be encouraged to consume more fiber-rich carbohydrates and less saturated fatty acids as well as maintain a high level of physical fitness to sustain military readiness during long-term deployments.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the energy requirement of simulated stair climbing. Metabolic costs of climbing stairs in getting to the scene of a fire can be very demanding for fire personnel. Heart rate and oxygen consumption were measured on 17 fire fighters during each of three conditions: (1) stair climbing without fire-fighting uniform or equipment, (2) stair climbing with fire-fighting uniform and equipment, and (3) pedaling a bicycle ergometer in a graded maximal exercise test. These three conditions were designed to determine (1) baseline reference values, (2) actual work task measures, and (3) maximum reference values. Results showed that climbing stairs with an 8-inch rise at 60 steps per minute with fire fighter's uniform and equipment (86.5 pounds) for five minutes required heart rates to reach 95% (84 to 100) of maximum effort, and oxygen consumption measures were found to be 80% (63 to 97) of maximum. It was concluded for the personnel studied that the rate of energy cost of climbing a simulated staircase with uniform and equipment required an ability to consume at least 2.7 L of oxygen per minute and 39 mL/kg/min.

AB  - Resistance exercise (RE) activates signalling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and it has been suggested that rapamycin-sensitive mTOR signalling controls RE-induced changes in protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, autophagy and the expression of peroxisome proliferator gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). However, direct evidence to support the aforementioned relationships is lacking. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR in the RE-induced activation of muscle protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, PGC-1α expression and hypertrophy. The results indicated that the inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR could prevent the induction of ribosome biogenesis by RE, but it only partially inhibited the activation of muscle protein synthesis. Likewise, the inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR only partially blocked the hypertrophic effects of chronic RE. Furthermore, both acute and chronic RE promoted an increase in PGC-1α expression and these alterations were not affected by the inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR. Combined, the results from this study not only establish that rapamycin-sensitive mTOR plays an important role in the RE-induced activation of protein synthesis and the induction of hypertrophy, but they also demonstrate that additional (rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-independent) mechanisms contribute to these fundamentally important events.

AB  - Occasionally firefighters need to perform very heavy bouts of work, such as smoke diving or clearing an accident site, which induce significant muscle fatigue. The time span for muscular recovery from such heavy work is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate firefighters' force-, neural-, metabolic-, and structural-related recovery after task-specific heavy work in the heat. Fifteen healthy firefighters (14 males and 1 female) performed a 20-min heavy work bout that simulated smoke diving and the clearance of an accident site at 35 degrees C. After the work, muscular recovery was evaluated by wrist flexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), average electromyography during MVC and during 10%MVC, rate of force production, motor response and stretch reflex responses, muscle oxygen consumption and oxygenation level, and wrist flexor muscle pennation angle. Recovery was followed for 4 h. Each of the 12 measured parameters changed significantly (p < 0.05) from those at baseline during the follow-up. Muscle oxygen consumption and the wrist flexor pennation angle remained elevated throughout the follow-up (oxygen consumption baseline, 12.9 +/- 1.7 mL O2.min(-1).(100 g)(-1); 4-h value, 17.5 +/- 1.6 mL O2.min(-1).(100 g)(-1); p < 0.05 and pennation angle baseline, 15.7 +/- 0.8 degrees ; 4-h value, 17.8 +/- 0.8 degrees ; p < 0.05). Muscle reoxygenation rate was elevated for up to 2 h (baseline, 2.3 +/- 0.4 mumol.L(-1).min(-1); 2-h value, 3.4 +/- 0.4 mumol.L(-1).min(-1); p < 0.05). The other 9 parameters recovered (were no longer significantly different from baseline) after 20 to 60 min. We concluded that the recovery order in main components of muscle function from fastest to slowest was force, neural, metabolic, and structural.

AB  - Exosomes are here defined as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the approximate size range of 30-100 nm in diameter, and are observed in most body fluids containing typical exosomal markers such as CD9, CD63, and CD81. Potential subpopulations of exosomes can be captured by targeting these markers using magnetic beads. Magnetic beads are versatile tools for exosome isolation and downstream analysis. Here, we describe the workflow of immuno magnetic isolation and analysis of exosomes by flow cytometry, Western immunoblotting, and electron microscopy.

AB  - Firefighters represent one of the riskiest occupations, yet due to the logistic reasons, the respective exposure assessment is one of the most challenging. Thus, this work assessed the impact of firefighting activities on levels of urinary monohydroxyl-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OHPAHs; 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 1-hydroxyacenaphthene, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene) and genotoxic/oxidative-effect biomarkers (basal DNA and oxidative DNA damage) of firefighters from eight firehouses. Cardiac frequency, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation were also monitored. OHPAHs were determined by liquid-chromatography with fluorescence detection, while genotoxic/oxidative-effect biomarkers were assessed by the comet assay. Concentrations of total OHPAHs were up to 340% higher (p</=0.05) in (non-smoking and smoking) exposed workers than in control subjects (non-smoking and non-exposed to combat activities); the highest increments were observed for 1-hydroxynaphthalene and 1-hydroxyacenaphthene (82-88% of summation operatorOHPAHs), and for 2-hydroxyfluorene (5-15%). Levels of biomarker for oxidative stress were increased in non-smoking exposed workers than in control group (316%; p</=0.001); inconclusive results were found for DNA damage. Positive correlations were found between the cardiac frequency, summation operatorOHPAHs and the oxidative DNA damage of non-smoking (non-exposed and exposed) firefighters. Evidences were raised regarding the simultaneous use of these biomarkers for the surveillance of firefighters' health and to better estimate the potential short-term health risks.

AB  - This work characterizes levels of eighteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the breathing air zone of firefighters during their regular work shift at eight Portuguese fire stations, and the firefighters’ total internal dose by six urinary monohydroxyl metabolites (OH-PAHs). Total PAHs (ΣPAHs) concentrations varied widely (46.4–428ng/m3), mainly due to site specificity (urban/rural) and characteristics (age and layout) of buildings. Airborne PAHs with 2–3 rings were the most abundant (63.9–95.7% ΣPAHs). Similarly, urinary 1-hydroxynaphthalene and 1-hydroxyacenaphthene were the predominant metabolites (66–96% ΣOH-PAHs). Naphthalene contributed the most to carcinogenic ΣPAHs (39.4–78.1%) in majority of firehouses; benzo[a]pyrene, the marker of carcinogenic PAHs, accounted with 1.5–10%. Statistically positive significant correlations (r≥0.733, p≤0.025) were observed between ΣPAHs and urinary ΣOH-PAHs for firefighters of four fire stations suggesting that, at these sites, indoor air was their major exposure source of PAHs. Firefighter’s personal exposure to PAHs at Portuguese fire stations were well below the existent occupational exposure limits. Also, the quantified concentrations of post-shift urinary 1-hydroxypyrene in all firefighters were clearly lower than the benchmark level (0.5μmol/mol) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

AB  - Obesity is an established colon cancer risk factor, while preventing or reversing obesity via a calorie restriction (CR) diet regimen decreases colon cancer risk. Unfortunately, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood, hampering development of mechanism-based approaches for preventing obesity-related colon cancer. We tested the hypotheses that diet-induced obesity (DIO) would increase (and CR would decrease) colon tumorigenesis in the mouse azoxymethane (AOM) model. In addition, we established that changes in inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and microRNAs are associated with these energy balance-colon cancer links, and thus represent mechanism-based targets for colon cancer prevention. Mice were injected with AOM once a week for 5 weeks and randomized to: 1) control diet; 2) 30% CR diet; or 3) DIO diet. Mice were euthanized at week 5 (n = 12/group), 10 (n = 12/group), and 20 (n = 20/group) after the last AOM injection. Colon tumors were counted, and cytokines, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), adipokines, proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of microRNAs (miRs) were measured. The DIO diet regimen induced an obese phenotype (∼36% body fat), while CR induced a lean phenotype (∼14% body fat); controls were intermediate (∼26% body fat). Relative to controls, DIO increased (and CR decreased) the number of colon tumors (p = 0.01), cytokines (p<0.001), IGF-1 (p = 0.01), and proliferation (p,0.001). DIO decreased (and CR increased) IGFBP-3 and apoptosis (p<0.001). miRs including mir-425, mir-196, mir-155, mir-150, mir-351, mir-16, let-7, mir34, and mir-138 were differentially expressed between the dietary groups. We conclude that the enhancing effects of DIO and suppressive effects of CR on colon carcinogenesis are associated with alterations in several biological pathways, including inflammation, IGF-1, and microRNAs.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cervical flexion, extension, protrusion, and retraction were comparatively measured in volunteers using a cervical range-of-motion device (Performance Attainment Associates, Roseville, MN), a 3space system (Polhemus, Colchester, VT), and lateral radiographs. OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of three methods of measurement of cervical flexion, extension, protrusion, and retraction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies compare cervical range-of-motion measurement devices with radiographic measurements, and no studies have compared methods of measurement for cervical protrusion and retraction measurement. METHODS: In 20 asymptomatic volunteers, four end-range sagittal cervical positions (flexion, extension, protrusion, and retraction) were measured simultaneously using a cervical range-of-motion device, a 3Space and lateral cervical radiographs. Measurements were compared, and differences were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences for flexion and extension measurements between the cervical range-of-motion device and that radiographic angle determined by an occipital line and the vertical, nor were there any between the 3Space and that radiographic angle between this same occipital line and C7. The cervical range-of-motion device and the 3Space measurements for flexion and extension, however, differed significantly from one another (P < 0.05). For protrusion and retraction, there was no significant difference between the 3Space and radiographic measurements, but these two both differed significantly from the cervical range-of-motion device (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Available methods of measurement differ as to whether the cervical spine is isolated or includes upper thoracic motion. Protrusion and retraction can be measured reliably with all three methods studied, but without measurement consistency between devices. Because end-range cervical flexion and extension-cannot occur in isolation from upper thoracic motion, true cervical motion can be measured only with an internally referenced, or landmark-based, methodology such as the 3Space. Even though the cervical range-of-motion device cannot measure isolated cervical flexion and extension, it is nevertheless a reliable clinical tool in measuring flexion and extension as well as protrusion and retraction as long as patient thoracic positioning is standardized to minimize the upper thoracic contribution.

AB  - We present data suggesting that corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) may be the causal gene of a previously identified quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with cortisol levels, fat, and muscle content in a pig intercross. Because Cbg in human and mouse maps in the region orthologous to the pig region containing this QTL, we considered Cbg as an interesting positional candidate gene because CBG plays a major role in cortisol bioavailability. Firstly, we cloned pig Cbg from a bacterial artificial chromosome library and showed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping that it maps on 7q26 at the peak of the QTL interval. Secondly, we detected in a subset of the pig intercross progeny a highly significant genetic linkage between CBG plasma binding capacity values and the chromosome 7 markers flanking the cortisol-associated QTL. In this population, CBG capacity is correlated positively to fat and negatively to muscle content. Thirdly, CBG capacity was three times higher in Meishan compared with Large White parental breeds and a 7-fold difference was found in Cbg mRNA expression between the two breeds. Overall, the data accumulated in this study point to Cbg gene as a key regulator of cortisol levels and obesity susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the biomechanical alterations during unilateral backpack carriage in adolescents and to compare the kinematic parameters of the loaded and unloaded sides. METHODS: Twenty adolescents (mean age: 13 +/- 1.2 years) were assessed during walking with no backpack and with a backpack on one shoulder. The kinematic parameters of a gait at a self-selected speed were analyzed using motion analysis. Specific kinematic peak points were compared between asymmetric walking; unloaded, loaded side and mean of unloaded walking. RESULTS: Peak ankle dorsal flexion, mean knee varum angle, peak value of hip extension and range of pelvic rotation decreased; and knee flexion at initial contact, hip adduction angle, mean pelvic anterior tilt and mean pelvic obliquity increased on the loaded side relative to the unloaded side and unloaded walking. Decreased maximum hip extension during late stance, increased hip adduction, elevated pelvis and increased anterior pelvic tilt were seen on the loaded side and the pelvis was lowered, ankle dorsal flexion increased and the hip was abducted on the unloaded side as a counter effect. CONCLUSION: Both the unloaded and loaded sides were affected by asymmetrical backpack carriage. The biomechanical alterations seen in asymmetrical backpack carriage may put some extra load on the lumbar vertebral joints and altered frontal knee biomechanics contribute to low back pain and pathologies in the knee joint.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities may provide indirect markers of the balance between sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular control. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the relationship between power spectral measurements of variabilities in RR interval, systolic arterial pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) obtained by microneurography over a range of blood pressures. In eight healthy human volunteers, MSNA, RR interval, intra-arterial pressure, and respiration were measured during blood pressure reductions induced by nitroprusside and during blood pressure increases induced by phenylephrine. Both low-frequency (LF; 0.10 +/- 0.01 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.23 +/- 0.01 Hz) components were detected in MSNA variability. Increasing levels of MSNA were associated with a shift of the spectral power toward its LF component. Decreasing levels of MSNA were associated with a shift of MSNA spectral power toward the HF component. Over the range of pressure changes, the LF component of MSNA variability was positively and tightly correlated with LF components of RR interval (in normalized units; P < 10(-6)) and of systolic arterial pressure variability (both in millimeters of mercury squared and normalized units; P < 5 x 10(-5) and P < 5 x 10(-6), respectively). The HF component of MSNA variability was positively and tightly correlated with the HF component (in normalized units) of RR-interval variability (P < 3 x 10(-4)) and of systolic arterial pressure variability (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: During sympathetic activation in normal humans, there is a predominance in the LF oscillation of blood pressure, RR interval, and sympathetic nerve activity. During sympathetic inhibition, the HF component of cardiovascular variability predominates. This relationship is best seen when power spectral components are normalized for total power. Synchronous changes in the LF and HF rhythms of both RR interval and MSNA during different levels of sympathetic drive are suggestive of common central mechanisms governing both parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiovascular modulation.

AB  - Microvesicles (MVs, also known as exosomes, ectosomes, microparticles) are released by various cancer cells, including lung, colorectal, and prostate carcinoma cells. MVs released from tumor cells and other sources accumulate in the circulation and in pleural effusion. Although recent studies have shown that MVs play multiple roles in tumor progression, the potential pathological roles of MV in pleural effusion, and their protein composition, are still unknown. In this study, we report the first global proteomic analysis of highly purified MVs derived from human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pleural effusion. Using nano-LC-MS/MS following 1D SDS-PAGE separation, we identified a total of 912 MV proteins with high confidence. Three independent experiments on three patients showed that MV proteins from PE were distinct from MV obtained from other malignancies. Bioinformatics analyses of the MS data identified pathologically relevant proteins and potential diagnostic makers for NSCLC, including lung-enriched surface antigens and proteins related to epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These findings provide new insight into the diverse functions of MVs in cancer progression and will aid in the development of novel diagnostic tools for NSCLC.

AB  - We hypothesize that spatiotemporal joint coupling patterns during gait are closely associated with musculoskeletal injury mechanics. Previous studies examining joint coupling, have primarily focused on coupling between single pairs of neighboring body segments or joints; thus falling short of characterizing the full spatiotemporal complexity across the entire gait apparatus. This study proposes the reliance on properties of the temporal cross-correlation of distinct joint variables as a means to characterize and detect differences in multiple segmental coupling pairs and to quantify how these couplings change between different gait conditions or test groups. In particular, for each subject, a characteristic diagram array is obtained whose entries include the maximum values of the cross-correlation between all pairs of joint variables as well as the associated phase shifts at which these maxima are recorded. Paired t-tests are then used to highlight significant differences in the corresponding entries between two gait conditions. In the present study, this technique was applied to angular displacement and velocity histories across 12 lower extremity joint variables, for healthy subjects with and without a brace on the right knee. As expected, the statistical analysis indicated that the temporal cross-correlations associated with the right knee-angle variables differed the most between the two gait conditions. In addition, significant differences (p<0.01) were found in the coupling between other pairs of joint variables, establishing a characteristic spatiotemporal signature for the changes from normative gait that result from reduced mobility at the knee.

AB  - The air bottle configuration (mass and size) used with a firefighter's self-contained breathing apparatus may affect functional gait performance and slip/trip/fall risk, contributing to one of the most common and costly fire ground injuries to this population. To examine the potential effect of bottle mass and size on firefighter gait performance, four 30-min air bottle configurations were tested. To quantify biomechanical gait performance, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on 24 male firefighters while walking at normal and fast speeds during three conditions (no obstacle, 10 cm or 30 cm stationary obstacle). Bottle mass, obstacle height and walking speed - but not bottle size - were found to significantly impact gait parameters. Ten subjects (42%) contacted the taller obstacle while wearing heavier bottles, suggesting greater risk for tripping. Heavier bottles also resulted in larger forces by the trailing leg in both the anterior-posterior and vertical directions, suggesting greater risk for slipping. These results suggest that increased bottle weight may result in a decrease in gait performance and an increase in fall risk. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Occupations, such as firefighting, often require use of a self-contained breathing apparatus that includes a pressurised air bottle. No systematic assessment has investigated how modest changes in load carriage due to bottle configuration (mass and size) might affect gait behaviour, especially when crossing obstacles. Bottle mass, but not size, was found to decrease gait performance and increase fall risk.

AB  - One of the most common causes of injuries among firefighters is slips, trips, and falls on the fireground. Acute fatigue from firefighting activities and/or carrying asymmetric loads might impact gait characteristics increasing slip, trip, and fall risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fatigue from simulated firefighting activities and carrying asymmetric loads (fire hose over one shoulder) on firefighters’ gait behavior. Both firefighting activities and asymmetric hoseload carriage led to shorter step lengths, stride lengths, single leg support time, and longer double leg support time, suggesting firefighters adopted cautious gait strategies. Simulated firefighting activities performed in either a live-fire training tower or laboratory-based environmental chamber using a firefighting activity simulator resulted in nearly identical effects on gait kinematics. This result suggests that gait assessment in a laboratory-based environmental chamber can be used as effective simulations in place of specialized burn facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To examine the effect of ambient temperature on metabolism during fatiguing submaximal exercise, eight men cycled to exhaustion at a workload requiring 70% peak pulmonary oxygen uptake on three separate occasions, at least 1 wk apart. These trials were conducted in ambient temperatures of 3 degrees C (CT), 20 degrees C (NT), and 40 degrees C (HT). Although no differences in muscle or rectal temperature were observed before exercise, both muscle and rectal temperature were higher (P < 0.05) at fatigue in HT compared with CT and NT. Exercise time was longer in CT compared with NT, which, in turn, was longer compared with HT (85 +/- 8 vs. 60 +/- 11 vs. 30 +/- 3 min, respectively; P < 0.05). Plasma epinephrine concentration was not different at rest or at the point of fatigue when the three trials were compared, but concentrations of this hormone were higher (P < 0.05) when HT was compared with NT, which in turn was higher (P < 0.05) compared with CT after 20 min of exercise. Muscle glycogen concentration was not different at rest when the three trials were compared but was higher at fatigue in HT compared with NT and CT, which were not different (299 +/- 33 vs. 153 +/- 27 and 116 +/- 28 mmol/kg dry wt, respectively; P < 0.01). Intramuscular lactate concentration was not different at rest when the three trials were compared but was higher (P < 0.05) at fatigue in HT compared with CT. No differences in the concentration of the total intramuscular adenine nucleotide pool (ATP + ADP + AMP), phosphocreatine, or creatine were observed before or after exercise when the trials were compared. Although intramuscular IMP concentrations were not statistically different before or after exercise when the three trials were compared, there was an exercise-induced increase (P < 0.01) in IMP. These results demonstrate that fatigue during prolonged exercise in hot conditions is not related to carbohydrate availability. Furthermore, the increased endurance in CT compared with NT is probably due to a reduced glycogenolytic rate.

AB  - The levels of circulating microparticles (MPs) are raised in various cardiovascular diseases. Their increased level in plasma is regarded as a biomarker of alteration in vascular function. The prominent MPs present in blood are endothelial microparticles (EMPs) described as complex submicron (0.1 to 1.0 μm) vesicles like structure, released in response to endothelium cell activation or apoptosis. EMPs possess both physiological and pathological effects and may promote oxidative stress and vascular inflammation. EMPs release is triggered by inducer like angiotensin II, lipopolysaccharide, and hydrogen peroxide leading to the progression of atherosclerosis. However, there are multiple physiological pathways for EMPs generation like NADPH oxidase derived endothelial ROS formation, Rho kinase pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Endothelial dysfunction is a key initiating event in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Atheroemboli, resulting from ruptured carotid plaques, is a major cause of stroke. Increasing evidence suggests that EMPs play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, acting as a marker of damage, either exacerbating disease progression or triggering a repair response. In this regard, it has been suggested that EMPs have the potential to act as biomarkers of disease status. This review aims to provide updated information of EMPs in relation to atherosclerosis pathogenesis.

AB  - Structural firefighting is a dangerous and physically demanding profession. Thus, it is critical that firefighters exercise regularly to maintain optimal physical fitness levels. However, little is known about optimal training methods for firefighters, and exercise equipment is often not available to on-duty firefighters. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a novel supervised on-duty physical training program on the physical fitness and occupational performance of structural firefighters. Twenty professional male firefighters were divided into a supervised exercise group (SEG; n = 11) and a control group (CG; n = 9). The SEG participated in a 12-week circuit training intervention. The SEG exercised for 1 hour on 2 d.wk. At baseline and after the intervention, subjects performed a battery of physical fitness tests and a simulated fire ground test (SFGT). At baseline, there were no significant differences (p = 0.822) in the completion rate of the SFGT in the SEG (82%) vs. the CG (78%). After the intervention, a significantly greater proportion of the firefighters in the SEG completed the SFGT compared with the CG (SEG = 100% vs. CG = 56%; p < 0.013). In addition, the SEG demonstrated significant improvements in body mass, fat mass, and body mass index (p </= 0.05). The findings of this study indicate that training with firefighter equipment improved occupational performance and anthropometric outcomes in incumbent firefighters. Furthermore, implementing a supervised exercise program using firefighter equipment can be done so in a safe and feasible manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many work in injury prone awkward positions that require adequate flexibility and strength in trunk stabilizer muscle groups. Performance on a functional movement screen (FMS) that assessed those factors was conducted and an intervention was designed. METHODS: A battery of FMS tests were performed on 433 firefighters. We analyzed the correlation between FMS performance and injuries and other selected parameters. An intervention to improve flexibility and strength in trunk stabilizer or core muscle groups through a training program was evaluated. RESULTS: The intervention reduced lost time due to injuries by 62% and the number of injuries by 42% over a twelve month period as compared to a historical control group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that core strength and functional movement enhancement programs to prevent injuries in workers whose work involves awkward positions is warranted.

AB  - A strong foundation in physical conditioning and sport-specific experience, in addition to a bespoke and periodized training and nutrition program, are essential for athlete development. Once these underpinning factors are accounted for, and the athlete reaches a training maturity and competition level where marginal gains determine success, a role may exist for the use of evidence-based performance supplements. However, it is important that any decisions surrounding performance supplements are made in consideration of robust information that suggests the use of a product is safe, legal, and effective. The following review focuses on the current evidence-base for a number of common (and emerging) performance supplements used in sport. The supplements discussed here are separated into three categories based on the level of evidence supporting their use for enhancing sports performance: (1) established (caffeine, creatine, nitrate, beta-alanine, bicarbonate); (2) equivocal (citrate, phosphate, carnitine); and (3) developing. Within each section, the relevant performance type, the potential mechanisms of action, and the most common protocols used in the supplement dosing schedule are summarized.

AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1/TRIM63 was identified 20 years ago and suspected to play important roles during skeletal muscle atrophy. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted to decipher the roles, molecular mechanisms and regulation of this enzyme. This revealed that MuRF1 is an important player in the skeletal muscle atrophy process occurring during catabolic states, making MuRF1 a prime candidate for pharmacological treatments against muscle wasting. Indeed, muscle wasting is an associated event of several diseases (e.g., cancer, sepsis, diabetes, renal failure, etc.) and negatively impacts the prognosis of patients, which has stimulated the search for MuRF1 inhibitory molecules. However, studies on MuRF1 cardiac functions revealed that MuRF1 is also cardioprotective, revealing a yin and yang role of MuRF1, being detrimental in skeletal muscle and beneficial in the heart. This review discusses data obtained on MuRF1, both in skeletal and cardiac muscles, over the past 20 years, regarding the structure, the regulation, the location and the different functions identified, and the first inhibitors reported, and aim to draw the picture of what is known about MuRF1. The review also discusses important MuRF1 characteristics to consider for the design of future drugs to maintain skeletal muscle mass in patients with different pathologies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the aerobic power of firefighters evaluated by means of laboratory and field tests. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 15 Italian male firefighters (age: 31 ± 6 years; BMI: 24.7 ± 2.1) was compared during a graded incremental treadmill test to exhaustion and an endurance field test (Queen's College step test) performed with and without wearing the protective clothing and the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) conditions. A 2 (conditions: with vs. without SCBA) × 2 (test setting: laboratory vs. field) ANOVA for repeated measures was used to verify significant differences (p &lt; 0.05). Pearson correlation and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Despite differences (p &lt; 0.01) emerged between Queen's College step test with SCBA values and the other tests, no significant correlations were observed. The evaluation of fitness level is important to avoid the risks of job-related injuries, ensuring that physically capable personnel could perform this crucial public safety occupation. Thus, the present results demonstrate that specific fitness tests should be used for monitoring changes in firefighter's health status and for guiding their training programme and that a periodic evaluation of firefighters can be performed in easy and accurate manner. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Italia.

AB  - This study aimed to 1) analyze the energy requirement (VO2eq) and the contribution of the aerobic (VO2ex), anaerobic alactic (VO2al), and anaerobic lactic (VO2la-) energy sources of a simulated intervention; 2) ascertain differences in mean VO2 and heart rate (HR) during firefighting tasks; and 3) verify the relationship between time of job completion and the fitness level of firefighters. Twenty Italian firefighters (age = 32 +/- 6 yr, VO2peak = 43.1 +/- 4.9 mL.kg.min) performed 4 consecutive tasks (i.e., child rescue; 250-m run; find an exit; 250-m run) that required a VO2eq of 406.26 +/- 73.91 mL.kg (VO2ex = 86 +/- 5%; VO2al = 9 +/- 3%; VO2la- = 5 +/- 3%). After 30 minutes, the recovery HR (108 +/- 15 beats.min) and VO2 (8.86+/-2.67mL.kg.min) were higher (p < 0.0001) than basal values (HR = 66 +/- 8 beats.min; VO2 = 4.57 +/- 1.07 mL.kg.min), indicating that passive recovery is insufficient in reducing the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain of the previous workload. Differences (p < 0.001) between tasks emerged for mean VO2 and HR, with a lack of significant correlation between the time of job completion and the firefighters' aerobic fitness. These findings indicate that unpredictable working conditions highly challenge expert firefighters who need adequate fitness levels to meet the requirements of their work. Practically, to enhance the fitness level of firefighters, specific interval training programs should include a wide variety of tasks requiring different intensities and decision-making strategies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the fitness level of Italian male recruits with (volunteers) and without (novices) previous fire-fighting experience. Strength (handgrip; 1RM bench-press), power (counter movement jump (CMJ)), velocity (20 m) and endurance (with and without self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)) performances of 29 volunteer (age: 22 ± 3 years; BMI: 23 ± 2) and 51 novice (age 30 ± 5 years; BMI 25 ± 2) fire-fighting recruits were compared (p &lt; 0.05). Volunteers showed better performances (p &lt; 0.01) for 1RM (80.5 ± 16.5 kg), CMJ (31.4 ± 4.8 cm) and 20 m (3.1 ± 0.2 s) than novices (1RM = 68.3±10.5 kg; CMJ = 28.0±4.5 cm; 20 m = 3.2 ± 0.2 s). No difference emerged for handgrip (481.7 ± 71.4 N) and VO2max with (42.9 ± 5.2 ml/kg/min) and without (54.7 ± 6.2 ml/kg/min) SCBA. Wearing the SCBA, 3% of volunteers and 16% of novices failed to complete the endurance test. Considering that fire fighters perform their job wearing SCBA, it could be advisable to test the fitness level of recruits in this condition. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2008.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of anterior load carriage on obstacle-crossing behaviour, with a focus on lower limb gait parameters. Nine male participants (age 23+/-1.8 years, height 176+/-5.0cm) volunteered. Participants either walked without a load (No Load), or carried a load (2KG (empty box), 5KG, 10KG), and stepped over a 20cm obstacle. Vision of the obstacle was obscured 1.0m to 1.3m prior to the obstacle. Significant correlations were found between trail limb toe distance and lead limb toe clearance, in the 2KG, 5KG, and 10KG conditions. Toe clearance increased with load (No Load, 147.3+/-13.9mm; 2KG, 162.5+/-15.6mm; 5KG, 167.6+/-17.6mm; 10KG, 173.9+/-17.5mm; p<0.0001). Trail limb toe distance, trail limb toe distance variability, lead heel distance variability, and lead limb toe clearance variability were greater in the 2KG, 5KG, and 10KG conditions, compared with the No Load condition. Participants adopted a conservative gait pattern during obstacle crossing when carrying a load, evidenced by increasing toe clearance, which may have been influenced by availability of visual information regarding obstacle position. In contrast with previous literature, increased lead limb toe clearance may have been associated with absence of relative surface height difference pre- and post-obstacle crossing.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In order to safely negotiate cluttered and dangerous environments, firefighters must efficiently and effectively make affordance judgments. Failure to do so could put them at risk for slips, trips, and falls, which are major causes of injuries for firefighters. We examined how well firefighters were able to perceive their obstacle crossing abilities while wearing firefighting protective equipment. Firefighters were asked to judge whether they could cross over, under, and through different obstacles that simulated idealized fireground situations. Perceptual judgment errors were found for each obstacle type, the largest occurring with an overestimation of ability to pass under an obstacle. Years of experience had a moderate positive correlation with absolute judgment error in the “over” and “under” obstacles. Overall, a general lack of awareness of their personal protective equipment for obstacle crossing ability was observed. A better understanding of how to reduce judgment error while wearing firefighter protective gear would likely decrease the risk of injuries on the fireground. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Firefighting demands performing heavy muscular work under adverse and potentially dangerous conditions. Although the physiological and psychological responses to simulated firefighting activities have been described, the heat strain has not been characterised using standardised indices of exercise-heat strain. The purpose of the study is to describe the physiological and perceptual strain associated with working in personal protective equipment and performing simulated firefighting activities in a hot environment using recently developed strain indices (Physiological Strain Index (PhSI); Perceptual Strain Index (PeSI)). Data from two previously published studies (Smith et al. 1995, 2001) - one a laboratory-based study and one a field-based study - were re-analysed incorporating the strain indices. The laboratory study involved walking on a treadmill for 15 min while wearing three different clothing and equipment configurations. The field study involved three trials of standardised firefighting tasks in a live-fire training structure (mean trial length = 5.76 min). Heart rate, rectal temperature, thermal sensations and ratings of perceived exertion were collected in each study. PhSI and PeSI values were calculated using the formulae developed by Moran et al. (1998b) and Tikuisis et al. (2002), respectively. PhSI and PeSI increased significantly over time in both studies. Even relatively brief bouts of exercise while wearing heavy impermeable clothing or simulated firefighting activity in the heat results in moderate to high levels of heat strain as assessed by PhSI and PeSI.

AB  - The relationship between exercise and anxiety has been extensively examined over the last 15 years. Three separate meta-analysis were conducted to quantitatively review the exercise-anxiety literature for state anxiety, trait anxiety and psychophysiological correlates of anxiety. Such a procedure allows tendencies of the research to be characterised. The results substantiate the claim that exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety, but only for aerobic forms of exercise. These effects were generally independent of both subject (i.e. age and health status) and descriptive characteristics. Numerous design characteristics were different, but these differences were not uniform across the 3 meta-analyses. For state anxiety, exercise was associated with reduced anxiety, but had effects similar to other known anxiety-reducing treatments (e.g. relaxation). The trait anxiety meta-analysis revealed that random assignment was important for achieving larger effects when compared to the use of intact groups. Training programmes also need to exceed 10 weeks before significant changes in trait anxiety occur. For psychophysiological correlates, cardiovascular measures of anxiety (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate) yielded significantly smaller effects than did other measures (e.g. EMG, EEG). The only variable that was significant across all 3 meta-analyses was exercise duration. Exercise of at least 21 minutes seems necessary to achieve reductions in state and trait anxiety, but there were variables confounding this relationship. As such, it remains to be seen what the minimum duration is necessary for anxiety reduction. Although exercise offers therapeutic benefits for reducing anxiety without the dangers or costs of drug therapy or psychotherapy, it remains to be determined precisely why exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety. Since several mechanisms may be operating simultaneously, future research should be designed with the idea of testing interactions between these mechanisms.

AB  - A primary objective of the present study was to examine the effect of short-term live-fire firefighting activities on key physiological, perceptual and psychological variables and whether occupational status influenced these responses. It was also of interest to examine whether individual difference factors differentiated the occupational status groups and if so, whether such individual difference factors influenced perceptual and psychological responses to firefighting activities. Male firefighters (n = 52 career, n = 53 volunteer firefighters) participated in 18 min of simulated firefighting activity in a training structure that contained live fires. Measures of heart rate (HR) and Tcore were obtained before and after firefighting activities along with perceptions of thermal sensations, exertion, respiratory distress and affect. Firefighting activities resulted in significant elevations in HR and Tcore , whereas thermal sensations, respiratory distress, exertion and affect all showed significant and sizable changes reflecting greater distress and dysphoria. Occupational status and individual difference factors accounted for some of this negative change. The findings replicate and extend previous work by demonstrating the influence of occupational status and individual difference factors in the psychological responses to firefighting activity.

AB  - The six-minute walk (6MW) has been established as a clinic-based, performance measure of walking endurance that reflects community ambulation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Consequently, identifying the contribution of variables to 6MW performance may provide targets for improving real-life walking in MS, and these variables may differ as a function of disability. This study examined cadence and stride length as gait variables that explain differences in 6MW performance between persons with MS and controls, and by level of disability. 256 community-residing persons with MS and 49 non-MS controls performed a standard 6MW test and completed 2 trials of comfortable walking on an electronic walkway for quantifying gait. Regression analyses indicated that cadence and stride length explain differences in 6MW performance between MS and controls, and by level of disability in MS. The contribution of cadence and stride length to walking endurance differed as a function of disability, such that cadence and to a greater extent stride length explained variance in 6MW performance in mild MS, whereas cadence and stride length explained approximately an equivalent amount of variance in 6MW performance in moderate-to-severe MS. We provide evidence for intervention strategies that are specific to disability level to improve walking endurance in MS.

AB  - Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people live primarily on a meat-based diet, while an estimated 4 billion live primarily on a plant-based diet. The US food production system uses about 50% of the total US land area, 80% of the fresh water, and 17% of the fossil energy used in the country. The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable. The use of land and energy resources devoted to an average meat-based diet compared with a lactoovovegetarian (plant-based) diet is analyzed in this report. In both diets, the daily quantity of calories consumed are kept constant at about 3533 kcal per person. The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet.

AB  - Objectives To update the mortality experience of a previously studied cohort of 29 992 US urban career firefighters compared with the US general population and examine exposure-response relationships within the cohort.Methods Vital status was updated through 2016 adding 7 years of follow-up. Cohort mortality compared with the US population was evaluated via life table analyses. Full risk-sets, matched on attained age, race, birthdate and fire department were created and analysed using the Cox proportional hazards regression to examine exposure-response associations between select mortality outcomes and exposure surrogates (exposed-days, fire-runs and fire-hours). Models were adjusted for a potential bias from healthy worker survivor effects by including a categorical variable for employment duration.Results Compared with the US population, mortality from all cancers, mesothelioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and cancers of the oesophagus, intestine, rectum, lung and kidney were modestly elevated. Positive exposure-response relationships were observed for deaths from lung cancer, leukaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Conclusions This update confirms previous findings of excess mortality from all cancers and several site-specific cancers as well as positive exposure-response relations for lung cancer and leukaemia. New findings include excess NHL mortality compared with the general population and a positive exposure-response relationship for COPD. However, there was no evidence of an association between any quantitative exposure measure and NHL.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the Cosmed K4b2 (Cosmed, Italy) portable metabolic system that measures FEO2, FECO2 and VE on a breath by breath basis. For gas concentration comparisons, expired air from 20 subjects performing treadmill running was collected in a 600 litre chain compensated Collins Tissot tank and analysed for FEO2 and FECO2 using a laboratory metabolic cart and the Cosmed K4 b2 metabolic system. For ventilation comparisons, serial steady state VE (STPD) values were measured on 10 subjects using the Cosmed K4b2 ventilation turbine and a Morgan ventilation monitor during a continuous treadmill running protocol at ascending speeds of 8, 11 and 14 km x h(-1). The Cosmed K4b2 FEO2 and FECO2 measures were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than the metabolic cart values. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and the standard error of measurement (SEM) demonstrated a high association between the Cosmed and the metabolic cart measures (FEO2 r =0 .971, SEM 0.071: FECO2 r = 0.925, SEM 0.087). Cosmed VE (l x min(-1)) measures were significantly greater than Morgan values at running speeds of 8 kmh(-1) (P < 0.001) and 11 kmh(-1) (P < 0.001) but not significantly different at 14 km x h(-1) (P > 0.05). When VE measures at the three running speeds were combined, the mean difference between instrument measures ranged between 3.5 - 4.0 l x min(-1) but the values were highly correlated (r= 0.982, P<0.01; SEM 3.03). Linear regression analysis revealed the following regression equations to predict metabolic cart values from Cosmed measures: FEO2 = 0.852+0.963 Cosmed (R2 = 0.940, P<0.00 1), FECO2 = 0.627+0.878 Cosmed (R2=0.856, P<0.001), VE = -2.50+0.984 Cosmed (R2 = 0.965. P < 0.001). The results indicated that the Cosmed K4b2 unit assessed here produced measures of FEO2, FECO2 and VE that had strong correlation to values obtained from a metabolic cart. However, linear regression analysis may further improve the accuracy of Cosmed K4b2 measures when compared to metabolic cart values.

AB  - Piotrowski, J. K. (1971).Brit. J. industr. Med.,28, 172-178. Evaluation of exposure to phenol: absorption of phenol vapour in the lungs and through the skin and excretion of phenol in urine. Volunteers were exposed to phenol vapour (5 to 25 mg/m(3)) by inhalation and through the skin, respectively, and the excretion of phenol in urine was examined. The retention of vapour in the lungs decreased from about 80 to 70% in the course of exposure. The absorption of vapour through the whole of the skin was approximately proportional to the concentration of vapour used, the absorption rate being somewhat lower than in the lungs. Almost 100% of the phenol was excreted in the urine within one day. The rate of excretion of phenol in the urine may be used as an exposure test which permits the absorbed dose to be estimated with a precision of about ±2 mg.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study sought to develop a comprehensive measure of fitness that is predictive of injury risk and can be used in the fire service to assess individual-level health and fit-for-duty status. METHODS: A retrospective occupational cohort of 799 career fire service employees was observed over the years 2005-2009. An equally weighted score for comprehensive fitness was calculated based on cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Repeated measures survival analyses were used to estimate the risk of any injury, sprain or strain, and exercise-related injuries in relation to comprehensive fitness. RESULTS: A well-distributed comprehensive fitness score was developed to distinguish three tiers of overall fitness status. Intraclass correlations identified flexibility, total grip strength, percent body fat, and resting heart rate as the most reliable fitness metrics, while push-ups, sit-ups, and aerobic capacity demonstrated poor reliability. In general, individuals with a lower comprehensive fitness status had an increased injury risk of injury as compared to the most fit individuals. The risk of any injury was 1.82 (95% CI 1.06-3.11) times as likely for the least fit individuals, as compared to individuals in the top fire fitness category, increasing to 2.90 (95% CI 1.48-5.66) when restricted to sprains and strains. CONCLUSIONS: This 5-year analysis of clinical occupational health assessments enabled the development of a relevant metric for relating comprehensive fitness with the risk of injury. Results were consistent with previous studies focused on cardiorespiratory fitness, but also less susceptible to inter-individual variability of discrete measurements.

AB  - We investigated whether endurance exercise might modify the blood antioxidant status and lipid profile after omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Two groups of healthy, fit males performed 1 h of exercise with a constant work load corresponding to 60% of their individual VO(2 max) and various pedaling rates (45 min-60 rev/min followed by a maximal rate), before and after receiving, over 6 weeks, omega-3 fatty acids in a daily dose of 1.3 g or placebo. The resting concentration of triglycerides decreased after omega-3 fatty acid consumption. In response to endurance exercise, the superoxide dismutase activity markedly decreased in sedentary control subjects. This effect was partially protected by omega-3 fatty acid consumption. Supplementation tended to increase atalase activity in response to exercise, and this activity was significantly higher after 1 h of recovery. We conclude that the beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during endurance exercise may be due to the activation of the superoxide dismutase and catalase pathways.

AB  - High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a promising fitness paradigm that gained popularity among military populations. Rather than biasing workouts toward maximizing fitness domains such as aerobic endurance, HIFT workouts are designed to promote general physical preparedness. HIFT programs have proliferated as a result of concerns about the relevance of traditional physical training (PT), which historically focused on aerobic condition via running. Other concerns about traditional PT include: (1) the relevance of service fitness tests given current combat demands, (2) the perception that military PT is geared toward passing service fitness tests, and (3) that training for combat requires more than just aerobic endurance. Despite its' popularity in the military, concerns have been raised about HIFT's injury potential, leading to some approaches being labeled as "extreme conditioning programs" by several military and civilian experts. Given HIFT programs' popularity in the military and concerns about injury, a review of data on HIFT injury potential is needed to inform military policy. The purpose of this review is to: (1) provide an overview of scientific methods used to appropriately compare injury rates among fitness activities and (2) evaluate scientific data regarding HIFT injury risk compared to traditional military PT and other accepted fitness activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in firefighters. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat percentage (BF%) were assessed in 478 career and 199 volunteer male firefighters from randomly selected departments. RESULTS: High prevalence rates of overweight + obesity (BMI >/= 25 kg/m) and obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m) were found in career (79.5%; 33.5%) and volunteer firefighters (78.4%; 43.2%). False-positive obesity misclassification based on BMI, compared to waist circumference and BF%, was low (9.8% and 2.9%, respectively). False negatives were much higher: 32.9% and 13.0%. Obese firefighters demonstrated unfavorable cardiovascular disease (CVD) profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity exceeded that of the US general population. Contrary to common wisdom, obesity was even more prevalent when assessed by BF% than by BMI, and misclassifying muscular firefighters as obese by using BMI occurred infrequently.

AB  - We present up to 45 years of cancer incidence data by occupational category for the Nordic populations. The study covers the 15 million people aged 30-64 years in the 1960, 1970, 1980/1981 and/or 1990 censuses in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and the 2.8 million incident cancer cases diagnosed in these people in a follow-up until about 2005. The study was undertaken as a cohort study with linkage of individual records based on the personal identity codes used in all the Nordic countries. In the censuses, information on occupation for each person was provided through free text in self-administered questionnaires. The data were centrally coded and computerised in the statistical offices. For the present study, the original occupational codes were reclassified into 53 occupational categories and one group of economically inactive persons. All Nordic countries have a nation-wide registration of incident cancer cases during the entire study period. For the present study the incident cancer cases were classified into 49 primary diagnostic categories. Some categories have been further divided according to sub-site or morphological type. The observed number of cancer cases in each group of persons defined by country, sex, age, period and occupation was compared with the expected number calculated from the stratum specific person years and the incidence rates for the national population. The result was presented as a standardised incidence ratio, SIR, defined as the observed number of cases divided by the expected number. For all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), the study showed a wide variation among men from an SIR of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.95) in domestic assistants to 1.48 (1.43-1.54) in waiters. The occupations with the highest SIRs also included workers producing beverage and tobacco, seamen and chimney sweeps. Among women, the SIRs varied from 0.58 (0.37-0.87) in seafarers to 1.27 (1.19-1.35) in tobacco workers. Low SIRs were found for farmers, gardeners and teachers. Our study was able to repeat most of the confirmed associations between occupations and cancers. It is known that almost all mesotheliomas are associated with asbestos exposure. Accordingly, plumbers, seamen and mechanics were the occupations with the highest risk in the present study. Mesothelioma was the cancer type showing the largest relative differences between the occupations. Outdoor workers such as fishermen, gardeners and farmers had the highest risk of lip cancer, while the lowest risk was found among indoor workers such as physicians and artistic workers. Studies of nasal cancer have shown increased risks associated with exposure to wood dust, both for those in furniture making and for those exposed exclusively to soft wood like the majority of Nordic woodworkers. We observed an SIR of 1.84 (1.66-2.04) in male and 1.88 (0.90-3.46) in female woodworkers. For nasal adenocarcinoma, the SIR in males was as high as 5.50 (4.60-6.56). Male waiters and tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer, probably attributable to active and passive smoking. Miners and quarry workers also had a high risk, which might be related to their exposure to silica dust and radon daughters. Among women, tobacco workers and engine operators had a more than fourfold risk as compared with the lung cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and teachers. The occupational risk patterns were quite similar in all main histological subtypes of lung cancer. Bladder cancer is considered as one of the cancer types most likely to be related to occupational carcinogens. Waiters had the highest risk of bladder cancer in men and tobacco workers in women, and the low-risk categories were the same ones as for lung cancer. All this can be accounted for by smoking. The second-highest SIRs were among chimney sweeps and hairdressers. Chimney sweeps are exposed to carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the chimney soot, and hairdressers' work environment is also rich in chemical agents. Exposure to the known hepatocarcinogens, the Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin, is rare in the Nordic countries, and a large proportion of primary liver cancers can therefore be attributed to alcohol consumption. The highest risks of liver cancer were seen in occupational categories with easy access to alcohol at the work place or with cultural traditions of high alcohol consumption, such as waiters, cooks, beverage workers, journalists and seamen. The risk of colon cancer has been related to sedentary work. The findings in the present study did not strongly indicate any protective role of physical activity. Colon cancer was one of the cancer types showing the smallest relative variation in incidence between occupational categories. The occupational variation in the risk of female breast cancer (the most common cancer type in the present series, 373 361 cases) was larger, and there was a tendency of physically demanding occupations to show SIRs below unity. Women in occupations which require a high level of education have, on average, a higher age at first child-birth and elevated breast cancer incidence. Women in occupational categories with the highest average number of children had markedly lower incidence. In male breast cancer (2 336 cases), which is not affected by the dominating reproductive factors, there was a suggestion of an increase in risk in occupations characterised by shift work. Night-shift work was recently classified as probably carcinogenic, with human evidence based on breast cancer research. The most common cancer among men in the present cohort was prostate cancer (339 973 cases). Despite the huge number of cases, we were unable to demonstrate any occupation-related risks. The observed small occupational variation could be easily explained by varying PSA test frequency. The Nordic countries are known for equity and free and equal access to health care for all citizens. The present study shows that the risk of cancer, even under these circumstances, is highly dependent on the person's position in the society. Direct occupational hazards seem to explain only a small percentage of the observed variation - but still a large number of cases - while indirect factors such as life style changes related to longer education and decreasing physical activity become more important. This publication is the first one from the extensive Nordic Occupational Cancer (NOCCA) project. Subsequent studies will focus on associations between specific work-related factors and cancer diseases with the aim to identify exposure-response patterns. In addition to the cancer data demonstrated in the present publication, the NOCCA project produced Nordic Job Exposure Matrix (described in separate articles in this issue of Acta Oncologica) that transforms information about occupational title histories to quantitative estimates of specific exposures. The third essential component is methodological development related to analysis and interpretation of results based on averaged information of exposures and co-factors in the occupational categories.

AB  - The postural and functional balance abilities of workers in physically demanding jobs were assessed in relation to age and occupation. Postural balance was tested with a force platform, and functional balance was measured during walking on a wooden plank. The subjects, 23-61 years of age, were fire fighters (men, n = 69), construction workers (men, n = 52), nursing staff (women, n = 51), and home care workers (women, n = 66). In the older (> or = 50 years) groups the time used for the functional balance test was 3-5 s longer and the velocity moment of the postural balance was 16-30 mm2/s higher than in the groups aged < or = 39 years. Construction workers performed better than fire fighters, and both groups had better functional balance than home care workers and nursing staff. The balance demands of work and deterioration with age should be taken into account when work ability is promoted, especially among older workers in physically demanding jobs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate a dynamic stability test and a functional balance test for trial-to-trial reproducibility and stability over time. In the dynamic stability test a subject stood on the force platform and moved his center of pressure through the targets shown on a computer screen. Functional balance was measured by a test in which the subject had to walk as fast as possible across a wooden plank without falling off. Both tests are repeated six times in two testing periods with an interval of two months. The subjects were 29 male firefighters aged 33 - 56 years. According to intraclass correlation coefficients the functional balance test showed good to excellent (0.78 - 0.96) trial-to-trial reproducibility and stability over time, and the results of the dynamic stability test were moderate (0.16 - 0.81). Individual variation in the repeated tests was considerable. However, the limits of agreement in the functional balance test (+/- 2 - 3 s) and in the performance time of the dynamic stability test (+/- 4 - 5 s) would be reasonable for practical use. Furthermore, the test-retest stability improved when the reliability was estimated from the best of at least three repeated trials with the functional balance test and the best of at least five trials with the dynamic stability test.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Firefighters must work on roofs, in smoky places, and on slippery surfaces while using fire-protective clothing and a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), together termed "fire-protective equipment" (FPE). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FPE on the functional and postural balance abilities of younger and older firefighters. METHODS: The subjects were professional firefighters in age groups 33-38 and 43-56 yr. Postural balance was tested with a force platform, and functional balance was measured during walking on a wooden plank with and without FPE. RESULTS: Wearing FPE significantly impaired both postural and functional balance. Postural balance with eyes closed was more negatively affected among the older subjects than the younger ones. Among the older subjects, the mean values for mediolateral velocity were 3.4 +/- 0.8 and 4.8 +/- 2.1 mm x s(-1) without and with FPE, respectively. The corresponding figures for velocity moment were 11.4 +/- 5.1 and 20.7 +/- 15.1 mm2 x s(-1). In the younger age group, the corresponding results were 3.6 +/- 1.0 and 4.1 +/- 1.4 mm x s(-1), in mediolateral velocity and 10.8 +/- 5.0 and 13.9 +/- 8.1 mm2 x s(-1) in velocity moment. SCBA was the most significant single piece of equipment to decrease performance in the functional balance test. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be taken into consideration for preventing balance-related injuries in firefighting and rescue work, especially for older firefighters. Furthermore, balance should be considered in developing FPE and training protocols for firefighter fitness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The importance of balance abilities for firefighting and rescue work has already been recognized, but there are no valid balance tests available in the test batteries for the physical work capacity of firefighters. Moreover, few studies have examined the associations between balance and work ability in general. Valid work-related balance tests are needed for the purpose of screening in occupational health care and in rehabilitation for assessing the effects of balance training. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of functional, postural and perceived balance in respect to work ability among firefighters at baseline and after a 3-year follow-up. METHODS: The subjects were 135 male firefighters aged 33-56 years. The outcome variables were the work ability index and perceived physical work ability (PWA), determined by questionnaire in 1996 and 1999. The predictors assessed in 1996 were postural balance (tested with a force platform), functional balance (measured during walking on a wooden plank), and perceived balance abilities, enquired about through a questionnaire. RESULTS: Most of the balance test results and the perceived balance ability were associated with the perceived PWA at baseline. The final logistic regression models showed that the best predictors of decreased work ability among firefighters after 3 years were poor-to-moderate perceived balance [odds ratios (ORs) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-6.6]; more than one error in the functional balance test (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.0-12.7); and a high mean amplitude of postural sway with the eyes closed (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-6.1). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the work-related and predictive validity, in terms of perceived work ability, perceived balance, errors in the functional balance test and amplitude of postural sway with the eyes closed, of measuring balance among firefighters.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the main and interactive effects of load carriage and fatigue on gait characteristics. Twelve young male participants were recruited in this study. Fatiguing protocol involved a running exercise, and fatigue was considered to be induced when the participants first gave an RPE rating at or above 17. Gait data were collected when the participants walked on a medical treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed, both before and right after the fatiguing exercise. Different back-carrying loads (i.e. 0, 7.5, and 15 kg) were applied separately to the participants during the walking trials. Gait variability measures and kinematic measures were used to quantify gait characteristics. The results showed that gait width variability, hip range of motion, and trunk range of motion increased with fatigue and with the application of the heavy load. These findings suggest that both fatigue and load carriage compromise gait. Findings from this study can help better understand how fatigue and load carriage affect gait, and further aid in developing interventions that are able to minimize fall risks especially with the application of fatigue and/or external load.

AB  - This review summarizes the current literature regarding the most discussed contraction-regulated moykines like IL-6, IL-15, irisin, BDNF, ANGPTL4, FGF21, myonectin and MCP-1. It is suggested that the term myokine is restricted to proteins secreted from skeletal muscle cells, excluding proteins that are secreted by other cell types in skeletal muscle tissue and excluding proteins which are only described on the mRNA level. Interestingly, many of the contraction-regulated myokines described in the literature are additionally known to be secreted by adipocytes. We termed these proteins adipo-myokines. Within this review, we try to elaborate on the question why pro-inflammatory adipokines on the one hand are upregulated in the obese state, and have beneficial effects after exercise on the other hand. Both, adipokines and myokines do have autocrine effects within their corresponding tissues. In addition, they are involved in an endocrine crosstalk with other tissues. Depending on the extent and the kinetics of adipo-myokines in serum, these molecules seem to have a beneficial or an adverse effect on the target tissue.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been implicated in various toxicities including neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, epigenetic toxicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. However, information on the accumulation of PFOA in the intestine and its toxic effects on intestinal epigenetics and tight junction (TJ) genes is sparse. CD1 mice were dosed with PFOA (1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day) for 10 days, and its accumulation and induced alterations in the expression of epigenetic and tight junction genes in the small intestine and colon were evaluated using LC-MS and qPCR techniques. PFOA reduced the expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) primarily in the small intestine whereas, in the colon, a decrease was observed only at high concentrations. Moreover, ten-eleven translocation genes (Tet2 and Tet3) expression was dysregulated in the small intestine, whereas in the colon Tets remained unaffected. The tight junction genes Claudins (Cldn), Occludin (Ocln), and Tight Junction Protein (Tjp) were also heavily altered in the small intestine. TJs responded differently across the gut, in proportion to PFOA dosing. Our study reveals that PFOA triggers DNA methylation changes and alters the expression of genes essential for maintaining the physical barrier of intestine, with more profound effects in the small intestine compared to the colon.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a manufactured perfluorochemical is a common surfactant and environmental pollutant found in various consumer products and water sources. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated its association with kidney dysfunction. However, the mechanisms that trigger kidney dysfunction following PFOA exposure is a gap in the field. The work presented explores the potential epigenetic indicators of kidney disease due to exposure to PFOA. In this study, 30 days old CD-1 mice were exposed to 1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day of PFOA for 10 days. Following acute oral exposure, epigenetic alterations and expression levels of various markers of fibroblast activation were evaluated in kidney tissues. We noted that PFOA-exposed mice exhibited differential methylation yielding 879 differentially methylated regions compared to vehicle. The mRNA expression revealed significant increase in Dnmt1 with decreased Rasal1 expression at higher levels of PFOA exposure suggestive of Rasal1 hypermethylation (an early indicator of fibroblast activation in kidney). Like Dnmt1, we also observed significant increase in Hdac1, 3 and 4. These are class I & II HDACs which are known to be critically altered in some renal diseases. Further, the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β and α-SMA significantly increased compared to vehicle. The KEGG and Go enrichment pathway analysis of reduced representation bisulfite data also revealed pathways implicated in renal fibrosis. Our study shows clear evidence of epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation and HDAC expression changes) in tissues from mouse kidney following PFOA exposure. Our results also suggest that epigenetic alterations in kidney promote the expression of early markers of fibroblast activation.

AB  - Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer and known endocrine disrupting chemical, which causes transgenerational reproductive toxicity in female rodents. However, the mechanisms of action underlying the transgenerational toxicity of DEHP are not understood. Therefore, this study determined the effects of prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure on various ovarian pathways in the F1, F2, and F3 generations of mice. Pregnant CD-1 dams were orally exposed to corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-750 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 10.5 until birth. At postnatal day 21 for all generations, ovaries were removed for gene expression analysis of various ovarian pathways and for 5-methyl cytosine (5-mC) quantification. In the F1 generation, prenatal DEHP exposure disrupted the expression of cell cycle regulators, the expression of peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors, and the percentage of 5-mC compared to control. In the F2 generation, exposure to DEHP decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, apoptosis factors, and ten-eleven translocation compared to controls. It also dysregulated the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) factors. In the F3 generation, ancestral DEHP exposure decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, PI3K factors, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis factors, Esr2, DNA methylation mediators, and the percentage of 5-mC compared to controls. Overall, the data show that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure greatly suppress gene expression of pathways required for folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in the ovary in a transgenerational manner and that gene expression may be influenced by DNA methylation. These results provide insight into some of the mechanisms of DEHP-mediated toxicity in the ovary across generations.

AB  - Some dietary supplements are recommended to athletes based on data that supports improved exercise performance. Other dietary supplements are not ergogenic per se, but may improve health, adaptation to exercise, or recovery from injury, and so could help athletes to train and/or compete more effectively. In this review, we describe several dietary supplements that may improve health, exercise adaptation, or recovery. Creatine monohydrate may improve recovery from and adaptation to intense training, recovery from periods of injury with extreme inactivity, cognitive processing, and reduce severity of or enhance recovery from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Omega 3-fatty acid supplementation may also reduce severity of or enhance recovery from mTBI. Replenishment of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency will likely improve some aspects of immune, bone, and muscle health. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of upper respiratory tract infection, which may indirectly improve training or competitive performance. Preliminary data show that gelatin and/or collagen may improve connective tissue health. Some anti-inflammatory supplements, such as curcumin or tart cherry juice, may reduce inflammation and possibly delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) does not consistently increase strength and/or lean mass or reduce markers of muscle damage, but more research on recovery from injury that includes periods of extreme inactivity is needed. Several dietary supplements, including creatine monohydrate, omega 3-fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics, gelatin, and curcumin/tart cherry juice could help athletes train and/or compete more effectively.

AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a critical role in the adaptation of skeletal muscle to persistent decreases or increases in muscle activity. This article outlines the basics of pathway function and reviews what we know about pathway responses to altered muscle use. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates proteolysis in mammalian cells by attaching ubiquitin polymers to damaged proteins; this targets the protein for degradation via the 26S proteasome. The pathway is constitutively active in muscle and continually regulates protein turnover. Conditions of decreased muscle use, e.g., unloading, denervation, or immobilization, stimulate general pathway activity. This activity increase is caused by upregulation of regulatory components in the pathway and leads to accelerated proteolysis, resulting in net loss of muscle protein. Pathway activity is also increased in response to exercise, a two-phase response. An immediate increase in selective ubiquitin conjugation by constitutive pathway components contributes to exercise-stimulated signal transduction. Over hours-to-days, exercise also stimulates a delayed increase in general ubiquitin conjugating activity by inducing expression of key components in the pathway. This increase mediates a late-phase rise in protein degradation that is required for muscle adaptation to exercise. Thus the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway functions as an essential mediator of muscle remodeling, both in atrophic states and exercise training.

AB  - Occupational noise exposure was evaluated for eight fire fighter positions on board three types of emergency vehicles. One hundred seventy code-3 responses were monitored and sound pressure levels in excess of 115 dBA found. Furthermore, sound pressures exceeding the OSHA allowable level of 90 dBA for eight hours exposure were determined. Octave band analyses were performed for overall code-3 noise and for specific noise sources on each vehicle. An evaluation of eighty-nine audiograms of fire fighters was also carried out. The findings of this study suggest that under present operational conditions fire fighters experience excessive short-duration, high intensity noise exposure and a hearing conservation program for the fire service is therefore recommended.

AB  - Herein we report on a rapid and highly sensitive scheme to detect trichloroethylene (TCE), an environmental contaminant, by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with multifunctional Au/TiO2 core-shell nanocomposites as SERS substrates. A facile approach to fabricate TiO2 shell around gold core nanocomposites is proposed as sensors for TCE detection by SERS. During detection, TCE was first oxidized due to the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 shell and the increase in SERS intensity due to the product of TCE photooxidation can be used to determine the concentration of TCE. It should be noted that the SERS of the Raman label, 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MPy) modified onto the gold nanoparticle (GNP) core is in proportion to the product of TCE photooxidation. After optimizing the sample pH, enrichment of the analyte, and the UV exposure time, the methodology developed accomplishes an excellent limit of detection (LOD) (0.038 μM, i.e.∼5 ppb) for TCE in water. Our unique approach based on the synthesized SERS composite to detect TCE, a chlorinated environmental contaminant directly in water could pave the way for the development of a multifunctional nanosensor platform to monitor TCE and the catalytic reactions in a multiplex format.

AB  - This paper reviews the current literature around the environmental impacts of dietary recommendations. The focus of the review is on collating evidence relating to environmental impacts of the dietary advice found in the World Health Organisation guidelines, and environmental impact literature: reducing the consumption of fat, reducing the consumption of meat-based protein and animal-based foods, and increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables. The environmental impact of reducing dietary fat intake is unclear, although reducing consumption of the food category of edible fats and oils appears to have little impact. However most, but not all, studies support environmental benefits of a reduced consumption of animal-based foods and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. In general, it appears that adhering to dietary guidelines reduces impact on the environment, but further study is required to examine the environmental impacts of animal-based foods, and fruit and vegetable intake in depth.

AB  - The 10 min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) is commonly used in laboratory studies to assess the impact of sleep loss, sustained wakefulness, and/or time of day on neurobehavioral performance. In field settings, though, it may be impractical for participants to perform a test of this length. The aim of this study was to identify a performance measure that is sensitive to the effects of fatigue but less burdensome than a 10 min test. Sixteen participants (11 female, 5 male; mean age = 21.7 years) slept in the sleep laboratory overnight then remained awake for 28 h from 08:00 h. During every second hour, participants completed three PVTs of differing duration (10 min, 5 min, 90 sec). For the 5 min/10 min comparison, ANOVA indicated that response time was significantly affected by test length (F1,14 = 26.9, p < .001) and hours of wakefulness (F13,182 = 46.1, p < .001) but not by their interaction (F13,182 = 1.7, ns). There was a strong correlation between response time on the 5 and 10 min PVTs (r = .88, p < .001). For the 90 sec/10 min comparison, ANOVA indicated that response time was significantly affected by test length (F1,14 = 65.9, p < .001) and hours of wakefulness (F13,182 = 29.7, p < .001) as well as by their interaction (F13,182 = 6.0, p < .001). There was a strong correlation between response time on the 90 sec and 10 min PVTs (r = .77, p < .001). The effects of hours of wakefulness on neurobehavioral performance were similar for the 5 min and 10 min PVTs. In contrast, performance on the 90 sec PVT was less affected by hours of wakefulness than on the 10 min PVT. In addition, performance on the 10 min PVT was more highly correlated with the 5 min PVT than the 90 sec PVT. These data indicate that the 5 min PVT may provide a reasonable substitute for the 10 min PVT in circumstances where a test shorter than 10 min is required.

AB  - Two models of a swimming snorkel connected to a portable metabolic cart (Cosmed K4 b2, Rome, Italy) were assessed using a gas exchange simulation system. Four standardized testing protocols were designed to mimic different swimming conditions and were performed similarly in three conditions so that both snorkels could be compared to measured values obtained by connecting the simulator directly with the gas analyzer. Simulated and measured values were highly correlated (R2 = 0.891 to 0.998) and in good agreement, with only a small overestimation of expiratory tidal volume (4 %, p = 0.005), not large enough to significantly affect the accuracy of ventilation or gas exchange parameters. Values measured using both swimming snorkels also highly correlated with simulated values, particularly for the ventilatory and primary gas exchange variables (R2 = 0.996 and 0.998 in both models for VO2 and VCO2, respectively). A moderate overestimation of FEO2 was observed in both models (2.65 % and 2.48 % relative, p = 0.03) and attributed to minimal mixing of inspiratory and expiratory gases, although not affecting VO2 measurements. We conclude that both snorkels are valid devices for measuring pulmonary breath-by-breath gas exchange parameters in connection with the K4 b2 across a wide physiological range.

AB  - The dynamic coordination of processes controlling the quality of the mitochondrial network is crucial to maintain the function of mitochondria in skeletal muscle. Changes of mitochondrial proteolytic system, dynamics (fusion/fission), and mitophagy induce pathways that affect muscle mass and performance. When muscle mass is lost, the risk of disease onset and premature death is dramatically increased. For instance, poor quality of muscles correlates with the onset progression of several age-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and aging sarcopenia. To date, there are no drug therapies to reverse muscle loss, and exercise remains the best approach to improve mitochondrial health and to slow atrophy in several diseases. This review will describe the principal mechanisms that control mitochondrial quality and the pathways that link mitochondrial dysfunction to muscle mass regulation.

AB  - Eight professional fire fighters participated in six fire fighting scenarios at a training facility. Data on heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperatures at the chest and thigh were collected using a portable data acquisition system. Average HR ranged from 122 to 151 beats.min-1 during the six scenarios. Detailed analyses indicated that HR and Tre increases are related to both the physical and environmental stresses of the various activities carried out. The most demanding activity, that of building search and victim rescue, resulted in an average HR of 153 beats.min-1 and Tre rise of 1.3 degree C, while the least demanding activity, that of the crew captain who directs the fire fighting, resulted in an average HR of only 122 beats.min-1 and a Tre rise of only 0.3 degree C. This study shows that fire fighting is strenuous work for those directly entering a building and performing related duties, but that the physical demands of other activities are considerably less. The results further suggest that heat strain injuries in fire fighters could perhaps be reduced by rotating duties frequently with other crew members performing less stressful work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors have been reported to be independently associated with coronary heart disease. However, previous studies have been in mainly North American or European populations. The aim of the present analysis was to investigate the relation of psychosocial factors to risk of myocardial infarction in 24767 people from 52 countries. METHODS: We used a case-control design with 11119 patients with a first myocardial infarction and 13648 age-matched (up to 5 years older or younger) and sex-matched controls from 262 centres in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and North and South America. Data for demographic factors, education, income, and cardiovascular risk factors were obtained by standardised approaches. Psychosocial stress was assessed by four simple questions about stress at work and at home, financial stress, and major life events in the past year. Additional questions assessed locus of control and presence of depression. FINDINGS: People with myocardial infarction (cases) reported higher prevalence of all four stress factors (p<0.0001). Of those cases still working, 23.0% (n=1249) experienced several periods of work stress compared with 17.9% (1324) of controls, and 10.0% (540) experienced permanent work stress during the previous year versus 5.0% (372) of controls. Odds ratios were 1.38 (99% CI 1.19-1.61) for several periods of work stress and 2.14 (1.73-2.64) for permanent stress at work, adjusted for age, sex, geographic region, and smoking. 11.6% (1288) of cases had several periods of stress at home compared with 8.6% (1179) of controls (odds ratio 1.52 [99% CI 1.34-1.72]), and 3.5% (384) of cases reported permanent stress at home versus 1.9% (253) of controls (2.12 [1.68-2.65]). General stress (work, home, or both) was associated with an odds ratio of 1.45 (99% CI 1.30-1.61) for several periods and 2.17 (1.84-2.55) for permanent stress. Severe financial stress was more typical in cases than controls (14.6% [1622] vs 12.2% [1659]; odds ratio 1.33 [99% CI 1.19-1.48]). Stressful life events in the past year were also more frequent in cases than controls (16.1% [1790] vs 13.0% [1771]; 1.48 [1.33-1.64]), as was depression (24.0% [2673] vs 17.6% [2404]; odds ratio 1.55 [1.42-1.69]). These differences were consistent across regions, in different ethnic groups, and in men and women. INTERPRETATION: Presence of psychosocial stressors is associated with increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, suggesting that approaches aimed at modifying these factors should be developed.

AB  - Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are cytoplasmaticreceptors regulating the expression of cortisol and bind to specific sites on chromatin. The glucocorticoid receptor gene (GRL) is located on chromosome 5q31 and encodes for either a 777-amino acid (GRalpha) or a 742-amino acid (GRbeta) polypeptide. The objective of the current study was to examine the prospective association of 3 polymorphisms-a Tth111I restriction fragment in the promoter region, a BclI polymorphism in intron 2, and an A/G polymorphism in exon 2-of the GRL gene on estimates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in 163 unrelated Swedish men born in 1944. These data showed a significant increase in body weight, body mass index, abdominal obesity, fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment over the 5-year follow-up among homozygotes for the rare BclI allele. In contrast, no significant associations with the Tth111I or A/G polymorphism were detected. It is concluded that the genetic information about GRL would be useful for further genetic study of obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic diseases.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Protein-leucine ingestion after strenuous endurance exercise accentuates muscle protein synthesis and improves recovery of muscle performance. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to determine whether a low-dose protein-leucine blend ingested after endurance exercise enhances skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR). METHOD: In a crossover design, 12 trained men completed 100 min of high-intensity cycling, then ingested either 70/15/180/30 g of protein/leucine/carbohydrate/fat (15LEU), 23/5/180/30 g of 5LEU, or 0/0/274/30 g of CON beverages in randomized order in four servings during the first 90 min of a 240-min recovery period. Muscle biopsies were collected at 30 and 240 min into recovery with FSR determined by L-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine incorporation and mTORC1 pathway phosphorylation by Western blot. RESULTS: The 33% (90% CL, +/-12%) increase in FSR with 5LEU (mean, SD: 0.080, 0.014%.h(-1)) versus CON (0.060, 0.012%.h(-1)) represented near-maximal FSR stimulation. Tripling protein-leucine dose (15LEU: 0.090, 0.11%.h(-1)) negligibly increased FSR (13%, +/-12% vs 5LEU). Despite similar FSR, mTORC1(Ser2448) phosphorylation only increased with 15LEU at 30 min, whereas p70S6K(Thr389), rpS6(Ser240/244), and 4E-BP1gamma(Ser112) phosphorylation increased with protein-leucine quantity at one or both time points. Plasma leucine and essential amino acid concentrations decreased during recovery in CON but increased with protein-leucine dose. Serum insulin was increased in 15LEU versus CON (60%, +/-20%) but was unaffected relative to 5LEU. Regression analysis revealed p70S6K-rpS6 phosphorylation moderately predicted FSR, but the associations with plasma leucine and essential amino acids were small. CONCLUSIONS: Ingesting 23 g of protein with 5 g of added leucine achieved near-maximal FSR after endurance exercise, an effect unlikely attributable to mTORC1-S6K-rpS6 signaling, insulin, or amino acids. Translating the effects of protein-leucine quantity on protein synthesis to optimizing adaptation and performance requires further research.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the total energy expenditure (TEE) by using the doubly labeled water (DLW) methodology during 5 d of wildfire suppression in Montana, California, Florida, Washington, and Idaho. METHODS: Seventeen wildland firefighters (from three Interagency Hot Shot crews, N = 8 men, height = 177 +/- 7 cm, weight = 74.6 +/- 6.4 kg, age = 24.5 +/- 1.8 yr; N = 9 women, height = 170 +/- 7 cm, weight = 65.2 +/- 8.0 kg, age = 25.0 +/- 1.3 yr) served as subjects. Before wildland fire suppression, each subject was given an oral dose of 2H2O and H218O (approximately 0.23 g 2H2O.kg estimated TBW-1 and 0.39 g H218O.kg estimated TBW-1). Urine samples were collected between 0400 and 0600 daily. TEE was calculated using the two-point method for days 1-3 and 1-5, with the TEE for days 4-5 calculated by extrapolation. Urine samples from other crew members not participating in the DLW protocol were collected at the same times and used to adjust calculations of isotopic elimination for background shifts. RESULTS: TEE was 17.4 +/- 3.7 and 17.5 +/- 6.9 MJ.d-1 during days 1-3 and 4-5, respectively. The energy expenditure associated with physical activity (EEA) was 8.8 +/- 3.0 and 8.9 +/- 6.1 MJ.d-1 for days 1-3 and 4-5, respectively. CONCLUSION: The current data demonstrate consistently high daily energy expenditure in the wildland firefighter. These data also demonstrate that the doubly labeled water methodology is an appropriate methodology for the measure of TEE during unpredictable field operations if adjustments are made for changes in background enrichment and elevated water turnover.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is associated with diverse adverse health outcomes, making it an important therapeutic target. Measurement of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion provides a window into this system. At present, no guidelines exist for the optimal use of this biomarker within randomised controlled trials (RCTs). PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to describe the ways in which salivary diurnal cortisol has been measured within RCTs of health or behavioural interventions in adults. METHODS: Six electronic databases (up to May 21, 2015) were systematically searched for RCTs which used salivary diurnal cortisol as an outcome measure to evaluate health or behavioural interventions in adults. A narrative synthesis was undertaken of the findings in relation to salivary cortisol methodology and outcomes. RESULTS: From 78 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 30 included healthy participants (38.5 %), 27 included patients with physical disease (34.6 %) and 21 included patients with psychiatric disease (26.9 %). Psychological therapies were most commonly evaluated (n = 33, 42.3 %). There was substantial heterogeneity across studies in relation to saliva collection protocols and reported cortisol parameters. Only 39 studies (50 %) calculated a rhythm parameter such as the diurnal slope or the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Patterns of change in cortisol parameters were inconsistent both within and across studies and there was low agreement with clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: Salivary diurnal cortisol is measured inconsistently across RCTs, which is limiting the interpretation of findings within and across studies. This indicates a need for more validation work, along with consensus guidelines.

AB  - Several dietary approaches have reduced cardiovascular events in randomized clinical trials. Replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat prevented coronary events in men, and a Mediterranean diet and fatty fish improved survival. None of these trials had much impact on total fat intake but rather increased vegetable oils, n-3 fatty acids, or many other plant foods or nutrients that are linked to coronary prevention. The reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by these dietary therapies compare favorably with drug treatments for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Improvement in blood lipid risk factors is an important mechanism to explain the results of trials of unsaturated fats. When saturated or trans unsaturated fats are replaced with monounsaturated or n-6 polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils, primarily low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreases. The LDL to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio decreases. When carbohydrates are used to replace saturated fats, in a low-fat diet, LDL and HDL decrease similarly, and the ratio is not improved; triglycerides increase as well when carbohydrate increases, except when low glycemic index foods are used. The n-3 polyunsaturated fats in fish oils suppress cardiac arrhythmias and reduce triglycerides, but they have little effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol levels. The theme should be that diet has benefits that come directly from foods, as well as from the reduction in saturated fats, cholesterol, meats, and fatty dairy foods. It is likely that many diets could be designed that could prevent CVD. This potential diversity is crucial for engaging the diverse cultures and tastes of people worldwide in cardiovascular disease prevention.

AB  - Global demand for meat and dairy products has increased dramatically in recent decades and, through a combination of global population growth, increased lifespan and improved economic prosperity in the developing world will inevitably continue to increase. The predicted increases in livestock production will put a potentially unsustainable burden on global resources, including land for production of crops required for animal feed and fresh water. Furthermore, animal production itself is associated with greenhouse gas production, which may speed up global warming and thereby impact on our ability to produce food. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find methods to improve the sustainability of livestock production. This review will consider various options for improving the sustainability of livestock production with particular emphasis on finding ways to replace conventional crops as sources of animal feeds. Alternatives, such as currently underutilised crops (grown on a marginal land) and insects, reared on substrates not suitable for direct consumption by farm animals, represent possible solutions. Coupled with a moderation of excessive meat consumption in wealthier countries, such strategies may secure the long-term sustainability of meat and milk production and mitigate against the adverse health effects of excessive intake.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Walking impairment is a prevalent, life-altering feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). There has been recent speculation that physiological deconditioning (i.e., reductions in aerobic capacity, balance, and muscular strength) contributes to walking and gait impairments in MS. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the associations among aerobic capacity, balance, and lower-limb strength asymmetries, walking performance, and gait kinematics in 31 persons with MS and 31 matched controls. METHODS: Participants underwent standard assessments of peak aerobic capacity, muscular strength (i.e., asymmetry between knee muscles), and balance. Walking performance was measured using the timed 25-ft walk (T25FW) and six-minute walk (6MW). Gait parameters were captured using a GaitRite electronic walkway. RESULTS: Aerobic capacity, balance, and knee-extensor asymmetry were associated with walking performance and gait in persons with MS (r=.2-.6) and explained differences in walking and gait variables between MS and control groups (R(2)=.27-.34). Aerobic capacity and lower-limb strength asymmetries, but not balance, explained significant variance in walking performance and gait kinematics in the MS sample (R(2)=.32-.58). CONCLUSIONS: Physiological deconditioning explains variability in walking disability in persons with MS and might represent a target of multimodal exercise training interventions for improving mobility outcomes in this population.

AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesised that six-minute walk (6MWT) distance of patients with ambulatory multiple sclerosis (MS)would differ from age-matched healthy control subjects. We also investigated the contribution of demographic, physical and physiological factors to impaired functional capacity in MS. METHOD: Thirty MS patients and 30 healthy subjects participated in this study. Respiratory muscle strength was measured. Pulmonary function test and 6MWT were performed. The Barthel Index (BI) was used to assess activities of daily living, and the Modified Ashworth Scale was used to determine spasticity. Symptomatic fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). RESULTS: Pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength of ambulatory MS patients were significantly lower, and baseline heart rate and fatigue perception were significantly higher than were healthy controls (p < 0.05). MS patients reached a significantly higher exercise heart rate, and walked significantly shorter distance than did healthy subjects (p < 0.05). The BI score, baseline heart rate and FSS score together accounted for 81 percent variance in 6MWT distance of MS patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The shorter distance covered during a 6MWT is determined by the limitations in activities of daily living,resting heart rate and subjective symptomatic fatigue in ambulatory patients with MS. Respiratory muscle weakness, lung function and level of neurological impairment do not contribute to impaired functional exercise capacity in these patients.

AB  - We hypothesised that, since anomalous neck proprioceptive input can produce perturbing effects on posture, neck muscle fatigue could alter body balance control through a mechanism connected to fatigue-induced afferent inflow. Eighteen normal subjects underwent fatiguing contractions of head extensor muscles. Sway during quiet stance was recorded by a dynamometric platform, both prior to and after fatigue and recovery, with eyes open and eyes closed. After each trial, subjects were asked to rate their postural control. Fatigue was induced by having subjects stand upright and exert a force corresponding to about 35% of maximal voluntary effort against a device exerting a head-flexor torque. The first fatiguing period lasted 5 min (F1). After a 5-min recovery period (R1), a second period of fatiguing contraction (F2) and a second period of recovery (R2) followed. Surface EMG activity from dorsal neck muscles was recorded during the contractions and quiet stance trials. EMG median frequency progressively decreased and EMG amplitude progressively increased during fatiguing contractions, demonstrating that muscle fatigue occurred. After F1, subjects swayed to a larger extent compared with control conditions, recovering after R1. Similar findings were obtained after F2 and after R2. Although such behaviour was detectable under both visual conditions, the effects of fatigue reached significance only without vision. Subjective scores of postural control diminished when sway increased, but diminished more, for equal body sway, after fatigue and recovery. Contractions of the same duration, but not inducing EMG signs of fatigue, had much less influence on body sway or subjective scoring. We argue that neck muscle fatigue affects mechanisms of postural control by producing abnormal sensory input to the CNS and a lasting sense of instability. Vision is able to overcome the disturbing effects connected with neck muscle fatigue.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of load weight carried by soldiers upon postural sway. Fourteen US Army enlisted men participated. Postural sway and muscle activity were measured while participants stood on a force plate. The load weight conditions, comprised of Army clothing and load-carriage equipment were 6, 16, and 40 kg. With an increase in load weight, stabilogram-diffusion analysis revealed that random movement of postural sway decreased. Also, with an increase in load weight, center of pressure excursions increased linearly but muscle activity changed minimally. In short, increasing load weight challenged the load carriers' stability, reduced the randomness of postural sway and required the load carriers to exert greater control of the load in order to maintain balance.

AB  - Acute physical exercise and repeated exercise stimuli affect whole-body metabolic and immunologic homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine plasma protein profiles of trained (EET, n = 19) and untrained (SED, n = 17) individuals at rest and in response to an acute bout of endurance exercise. Participants completed a bicycle exercise test at an intensity corresponding to 80% of their VO2max. Plasma samples were taken before, directly after, and three hours after exercise and analyzed using multiplex immunoassays. Seventy-eight plasma variables were included in the final analysis. Twenty-nine variables displayed significant acute exercise effects in both groups. Seven proteins differed between groups, without being affected by acute exercise. Among these A2Macro and IL-5 were higher in EET individuals while leptin showed elevated levels in SED individuals. Fifteen variables revealed group and time differences with elevated levels for IL-3, IL-7, IL-10, and TNFR2 in EET individuals. An interaction effect could be observed for nine variables including IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-3, and muscle damage markers. The proteins that differ between groups indicate a long-term exercise effect on plasma protein concentrations. These findings might be of importance in the development of exercise-based strategies in the prevention and therapy of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases and for training monitoring.

AB  - PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that physiological and perceptual heat strain is exacerbated on the second of back-to-back days of fire suppression work despite evidence of full recovery. METHODS: Twenty-six career and volunteer firefighters (age = 31 +/- 8 yr) completed 20 min of near maximal fire suppression work on consecutive days. Dependent variables were core temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and thermal sensation, which were measured before and after fire suppression. Urine specific gravity and body mass were also measured upon arrival at the fire academy as an index of hydration and recovery between days. RESULTS: Urine specific gravity (1.007 +/- 0.006 vs 1.005 +/- 0.006), body mass (87.7 +/- 16.1 vs 87.8 +/- 16.0 kg), heart rate (77 +/- 14 vs 76 +/- 14 bpm), and core temperature (37.2 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C vs 37.1 degrees C +/- 0.7 degrees C) were not different upon arrival on day 1 compared with day 2 (P >/= 0.26). The increase in core temperature during fire suppression was higher on day 2 (0.7 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C vs 1.1 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C, P < 0.01). Heart rate did not differ (after fire suppression: day 1 = 174 +/- 19, day 2 = 169 +/- 30 bpm, P = 0.60). The magnitude of increase in perceived exertion during fire suppression was greater on day 2 (6.7 +/- 1.6 vs 7.4 +/- 1.6 a.u., P < 0.01). Absolute thermal sensation at the end of fire suppression was greater on day 2 (3.8 +/- 0.8 vs 4.3 +/- 0.6 a.u., P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Physiological and perceptual heat strain is higher on the second of back-to-back days of fire suppression work.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the anabolic window theory by investigating muscle strength, hypertrophy, and body composition changes in response to an equal dose of protein consumed either immediately pre- versus post-resistance training (RT) in trained men. Subjects were 21 resistance-trained men (>1 year RT experience) recruited from a university population. After baseline testing, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups: a group that consumed a supplement containing 25 g protein and 1 g carbohydrate immediately prior to exercise (PRE-SUPP) (n = 9) or a group that consumed the same supplement immediately post-exercise (POST-SUPP) (n = 12). The RT protocol consisted of three weekly sessions performed on non-consecutive days for 10 weeks. A total-body routine was employed with three sets of 8–12 repetitions for each exercise. Results showed that pre- and post-workout protein consumption had similar effects on all measures studied (p > 0.05). These findings refute the contention of a narrow post-exercise anabolic window to maximize the muscular response and instead lends support to the theory that the interval for protein intake may be as wide as several hours or perhaps more after a training bout depending on when the pre-workout meal was consumed.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between time to reach critical end points (tolerance time [TT] and metabolic rate for three different environmental temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C, 50% relative humidity), while wearing firefighting protective clothing (FPC) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Thirty-seven Toronto firefighters (33 male and 4 female) were divided into four work groups defined as Heavy (H, n = 9), Moderate (M, n = 9), Light (L, n = 10), and Very Light (VL, n = 9). At 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C, TT (min) decreased from 56 to 47 to 41 for H, 92 to 65 to 54 for M, 134 to 77 to 67 for L, and 196 to 121 to 87 for VL. Significant differences in TT were observed across all group comparisons, excluding M versus L at 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C, and H versus M at 35 degrees C. Comparing 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C, M, L, and VL had significant decreases in TT, whereas only VL had a significant decrease when 30 degrees C was compared to 35 degrees C. For 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C, the relative change in TT was significantly greater for L (37%) and VL (41%) compared with H (16%) and M (26%). For 30 degrees C to 35 degrees C, the relative change among the groups was similar and approximately 17%. During passive recovery at 35 degrees C, rectal temperature (T(re)) continued to increase 0.5 degrees C above T(re final), whereas heart rate declined significantly. These findings show the differential impact of environmental conditions at various metabolic rates on TT while wearing FPC and SCBA. Furthermore, these findings reveal passive recovery may not be sufficient to reduce T(re) below pre-recovery levels when working at higher metabolic rates in hot environments.

AB  - This study examined whether active or passive cooling during intermittent work reduced the heat strain associated with wearing firefighting protective clothing (FPC) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the heat (35 degrees Celsius, 50% relative humidity). Fifteen male Toronto firefighters participated in the heat-stress trials. Subjects walked at 4.5 km.h(-1) with 0% elevation on an intermittent work (50 min) and rest (30 min) schedule. Work continued until rectal temperature (T(re)) reached 39.5 degrees Celsius, or heart rate (HR) reached 95% of maximum or exhaustion. One of three cooling strategies, forearm submersion (FS), mister (M), and passive cooling (PC) were employed during the rest phases. Tolerance time (TT) and total work time (WT) (min) were significantly increased during FS (178.7 +/- 13.0 and 124.7 +/- 7.94, respectively) and M (139.1 +/- 8.28 and 95.1 +/- 4.96, respectively), compared with PC (108.0 +/- 3.59 and 78.0 +/- 3.59). Furthermore, TT and WT were significantly greater in FS compared with M. Rates of T(re) increase, HR and T-(sk) were significantly lower during active compared with passive cooling. In addition, HR and T(re) values in FS were significantly lower compared with M after the first rest phase. During the first rest phase, T(re) dropped significantly during FS (approximately 0.4 degree Celsius) compared with M (approximately 0.08 degree Celsius) while PC increased (approximately 0.2 degree Celsius). By the end of the second rest period T(re) was 0.9 degree Celsius lower in FS compared with M. The current findings suggest that there is a definite advantage when utilizing forearm submersion compared with other methods of active or passive cooling while wearing FPC and SCBA in the heat.

AB  - This study examined different fluid replacement quantities during intermittent work while wearing firefighting protective clothing and self-contained breathing apparatus in the heat (35 degrees C, 50% relative humidity). Twelve firefighters walked at 4.5 km per h with 0% elevation on an intermittent work (50 min) and rest (30 min) schedule until they reached a rectal temperature of 39.5 degrees C during work periods and 40.0 degrees C during rest, heart rates of 95% of maximum and/or exhaustion. During the heat-stress trials subjects received one of four fluid replacement quantities, high (H), moderate (M), low (L), and no hydration (NH), where H, M and L represented 78%, 63% and 37% of fluid loss, respectively. The total tolerance time (work + rest) was significantly greater during H (111.8 +/- 3.5), M (112.9 +/- 5.2) and L (104.2 +/- 5.8) compared to NH (95.3 +/- 3.8). In addition, work time (min), which excluded rest periods, was significantly greater in H (82.6 +/- 3.5), and M (82.9 +/- 5.2) compared to NH (65.3 +/- 3.8). It is concluded that incorporating even partial fluid replacement strategies while wearing firefighting protective clothing and self-contained breathing apparatus in the heat improves tolerance time.

AB  - The large serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR regulates cellular and organismal homeostasis by coordinating anabolic and catabolic processes with nutrient, energy, and oxygen availability and growth factor signaling. Cells and organisms experience a wide variety of insults that perturb the homeostatic systems governed by mTOR and therefore require appropriate stress responses to allow cells to continue to function. Stress can manifest from an excess or lack of upstream signals or as a result of genetic perturbations in upstream effectors of the pathway. mTOR nucleates two large protein complexes that are important nodes in the pathways that help buffer cells from stresses, and are implicated in the progression of stress-associated phenotypes and diseases, such as aging, tumorigenesis, and diabetes. This review focuses on the key components of the mTOR complex 1 pathway and on how various stresses impinge upon them.

AB  - Laparoscopic surgeons perform precise and time consuming procedures while holding awkward poses in their upper body and arms. There is an ongoing effort to produce robotic tools for laparoscopic surgery that will simplify these tasks and reduce risk of errors to help both the surgeon and the patient. STIFF-FLOP is an ongoing EU FP7 project focusing on this by creating a stiffness controllable soft robotic manipulator. This paper reports on a study to test the soft manipulator's learnability and the effort associated with its use. The tests involved a limited prototype of the manipulator with a custom built test rig and EMG acquisition system. Task times and video recordings along with EMG waveforms from the forearm muscles of participants (n=25) were measured for objective assessment. A questionnaire was also provided to the participants for subjective assessment. The data shows that in average EMG levels were 25.9% less in RMS when using the STIFF-FLOP arm than when conventional laparoscopic tools were used. In terms of learnability, from the first to the second attempt on the STIFF-FLOP manipulator, elapsed time was reduced by an average of 32.1%. Further details and analysis of the EMG signals as well as time and questionnaire results is presented in the paper.

AB  - Organophosphates (OPs) are neurotoxic agents also used as pesticides that can permanently block the active site of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE). A robust and sensitive detection system of OPs utilising the enzyme mimic potential of the cysteamine capped gold nanoparticles (C-AuNPs) was developed. The detection assay was performed by stepwise addition of AChE, parathion ethyl (PE)-a candidate OP, acetylcholine chloride (ACh), C-AuNPs, and 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the buffer solution. The whole sensing protocol completes in 30-40 min, including both incubations. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) results indicated that the NPs are spherical and have an average size of 13.24 nm. The monomers of C-AuNPs exhibited intense catalytic activity (nanozyme) for the oxidization of TMB, revealed by the production of instant blue colour and confirmed by a sharp peak at 652 nm. The proposed biosensor's detection limit and linear ranges were 5.8 ng·mL(-1) and 11.6-92.8 ng·mL(-1), respectively, for PE. The results strongly advocate that the suggested facile colorimetric biosensor may provide an excellent platform for on-site monitoring of OPs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of physiological characteristics during firefighting performance, as assessed by the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT). Subjects included career and volunteer firefighters aged 18-39 (N = 33). Upper- and lower-body strength, muscle endurance, lower body muscle power, body composition analysis, aerobic capacity, anaerobic fitness, and the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure response to stair climbing were assessed to determine the physiological characteristics of the subjects. To quantify firefighting performance, the CPAT was administered by members of the fire service. Absolute and relative mean power during the Wingate anaerobic cycling test (WAnT), relative peak power during the WAnT, and absolute maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were significantly higher in those who passed the CPAT (N = 18), compared to those who failed (N = 15; p < 0.01). Mean power during the WAnT, fatigue index during WAnT, absolute VO2max, upper body strength, grip strength, and the HR response to stair climbing were significantly related to CPAT performance time (p < 0.01). Absolute VO2max and anaerobic fatigue resistance during WAnT best predicted CPAT performance (Adj. R2 = 0.817; p < 0.001). Performance on the ceiling breach and pull was the only CPAT task that was not significantly related to the physiological characteristics assessed. Measures of anaerobic and cardiovascular fitness best predict overall CPAT performance, and individual task performance. Remedial programs aimed at improving firefighting performance should target anaerobic and aerobic fitness qualities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle regeneration depends on satellite cells, myogenic stem cells that reside on the myofiber surface. Reduced numbers and/or decreased myogenic aptitude of these cells may impede proper maintenance and contribute to the age-associated decline in muscle mass and repair capacity. Endurance exercise was shown to improve muscle performance; however, the direct impact on satellite cells in aging was not yet thoroughly determined. Here, we focused on characterizing the effect of moderate-intensity endurance exercise on satellite cell, as possible means to attenuate adverse effects of aging. Young and old rats of both genders underwent 13 weeks of treadmill-running or remained sedentary. METHODOLOGY: Gastrocnemius muscles were assessed for the effect of age, gender and exercise on satellite-cell numbers and myogenic capacity. Satellite cells were identified in freshly isolated myofibers based on Pax7 immunostaining (i.e., ex-vivo). The capacity of individual myofiber-associated cells to produce myogenic progeny was determined in clonal assays (in-vitro). We show an age-associated decrease in satellite-cell numbers and in the percent of myogenic clones in old sedentary rats. Upon exercise, there was an increase in myofibers that contain higher numbers of satellite cells in both young and old rats, and an increase in the percent of myogenic clones derived from old rats. Changes at the satellite cell level in old rats were accompanied with positive effects on the lean-to-fat Gast muscle composition and on spontaneous locomotion levels. The significance of these data is that they suggest that the endurance exercise-mediated boost in both satellite numbers and myogenic properties may improve myofiber maintenance in aging.

AB  - Purpose: This paper reports the results of unannounced evacuation of two residential care premises providing accommodation for people with learning disabilities. Method: Awareness of disability has in relation to fire safety focussed generally on mobility. With the advent of performance-based fire safety engineering codes which require the characterization of buildings and their occupants it is necessary to obtain knowledge of the likely behaviours of people with learning difficulties in an emergency. The unannounced evacuations which were conducted at 11.30 pm were video recorded to enable observation and an analysis of the residents' behaviours. Results and Conclusion: The results and observations obtained raise many issues; including transferable training skills, predictability of evacuation behaviours, and the need in performance code evaluation to consider the characterization of buildingsand their occupants as mutually inclusiveprocesses.

AB  - A minimum cardiorespiratory fitness standard was derived for firefighters following a metabolic demands analysis. Design and minimal acceptable performance of generic firefighting task simulations (i.e. hose running, casualty evacuation, stair climb, equipment carry, wild-land fire) were endorsed by a panel of operationally experienced experts. Sixty-two UK firefighters completed these tasks wearing a standard protective firefighting ensemble while being monitored for peak steady-state metabolic demand and cardiovascular strain. Four tasks, endorsed as valid operational simulations by >/=90% of participants (excluding wild-land fire; 84%), were deemed to be a sufficiently valid and reliable basis for a fitness standard. These tasks elicited an average peak steady-state metabolic cost of 38.1 +/- 7.8 ml kg-1 min-1. It is estimated that healthy adults can sustain the total duration of these tasks (~16 min) at </=90% maximum oxygen uptake and a cardiorespiratory fitness standard of >/=42.3 ml kg-1 min-1 would be required to sustain work. Practitioner Summary: A cardiorespiratory fitness standard for firefighters of >/=42.3 ml kg-1 min-1 was derived from monitoring minimum acceptable performance of essential tasks. This study supports the implementation of a routine assessment of this fitness standard for all UK operational firefighters, to ensure safe physical preparedness for occupational performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During daily activities, the active control of balance often is a task per se (for example, when standing in a moving bus). Other constraints like fatigue can add to the complexity of this balance task. In the present experiment, we examined how moderate fatigue induced by fast walking on a treadmill challenged dynamic balance control. We also examined if the attentional demands for performing the balance task varied with fatigue. METHODS: Subjects (n = 10) performed simultaneously a dynamic balance control task and a probe reaction time task (RT) (serving as an indicator of attentional demands) before and after three periods of moderate fatigue (fast walking on a treadmill). For the balance control task, the real-time displacement of the centre of pressure (CP) was provided on a monitor placed in front of the subject, at eye level. Subjects were asked to keep their CP within a target (moving box) moving upward and downward on the monitor. The tracking performance was measured (time spent outside the moving box) and the CP behavior analyzed (mean CP speed and mean frequency of the CP velocity). RESULTS: Moderate fatigue led to an immediate decrement of the performance on the balance control task; increase of the percentage of time spent outside the box and increase of the mean CP speed. Across the three fatigue periods, subjects improved their tracking performance and reduced their mean CP speed. This was achieved by increasing their frequency of actions; mean frequency of the CP velocity were higher for the fatigue periods than for the no fatigue periods. Fatigue also induced an increase in the attentional demands suggesting that more cognitive resources had to be allocated to the balance task with than without fatigue. CONCLUSION: Fatigue induced by fast walking had an initial negative impact on the control of balance. Nonetheless, subjects were able to compensate the effect of the moderate fatigue by increasing the frequency of actions. This adaptation, however, required that a greater proportion of the cognitive resources be allocated to the active control of the balance task.

AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of y-6 and y-3 essential fatty acids. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of y-6 to y-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 10:1 to 20:1 instead of the traditional range of 1:1 to 2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of y-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction, and decreases in bleeding time. y-3 fatty acids, however, have anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. Excessive radical formation and trauma during high-intensity exercise leads to an inflammatory state that is made worse by the increased amount of y-6 fatty acids in Western diets, although this can be counteracted by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). For the majority of athletes, especially those at the leisure level, general guidelines should include EPA and DHA of about 1 to 2 g/d at a ratio of EPA:DHA of 2:1.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of prolonged load carriage on lower limb muscle activity displayed by female recreational hikers. Electromyography (EMG) signals from vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GM) were recorded for fifteen female hikers carrying four loads (0%, 20%, 30% and 40% body weight (BW)) over 8 km. Muscle burst duration, muscle burst onset relative to initial contact and integrated EMG signals (iEMG) were calculated to evaluate muscle activity, whereas the shift in mean power frequency (MPF) was used to evaluate muscle fatigue. Increased walking distance significantly decreased the MPF of TA; decreased the iEMG for VL, ST and GM; and shortened VL muscle burst duration. Furthermore, carrying 20-40% BW loads significantly increased VL and GM iEMG and increased BF muscle burst duration, whereas a 40% BW load caused a later VL muscle burst onset. The differences observed in muscle activity with increased load mass seem to be adjustments aimed at maintaining balance and attenuating the increased loads placed on the lower limbs during gait. Based on the changes in muscle activity, a backpack load limit of 30% BW may reduce the risk of lower limb injury for female hikers during prolonged walking.

AB  - Backpack load carriage increases ground reaction forces and increases the stiffness in the upper extremity that can cause transmission of higher amount of forces from the lower extremity to the head. This study investigated the effect of load carriage and placement of load on the back on the shock transmission mechanisms amongst children. Fifteen primary school boys with mean age 10.01 (+/-1.31) years, mean height 136.40 (+/-10.08)cm and mean mass 31.83 (+/-7.13)kg completed the study. Subjects carried 10%, 15% and 20% bodyweight (BW) loads on two locations on the back, namely upper and lower. Results showed a significant reduction in pelvic and trunk rotation in the transverse plane and an increase in the upper body stiffness for loads exceeding 15% of BW. The lower limb results showed a reduction in the first peak force and cadence and a significant change in the walking velocity and time to the first peak force for 20% load. No significant differences were found for the load configuration but the upper configuration showed slightly higher shock transmission. The changes in the lower limb dynamics indicated that there are locomotion mechanisms in place amongst children to modulate shock transmission to the head.

AB  - Backpack loads for school children have increased over the last two decades raising concerns among medical practitioners and parents about the possible detrimental effects. Gait instability induced due to backpack load carriage is of concern especially for young children with insufficient motor control skills to resist falls. The present study investigated the impact of backpack load carriage and its vertical position on the back on temporal-spatial and kinematic parameters associated with gait and postural stability for static and dynamic conditions. 17 participants with mean age 9.65 (+/-1.58) years, mean height 134.41 (+/-11.01) cm and mean mass 31.09 (+/-7.01) kg participated in the study. For dynamic conditions, the participants walked on an instrumented treadmill with 10%, 15% and 20% bodyweight (BW) loads on two locations on the back. Kinematic and temporal-spatial data was collected on the participants. Walking velocity, cadence and double support time for 20% load condition were significantly different compared to the unloaded condition indicating that gait changes may have occurred to minimize gait destabilization. Placing load low on the back affected the spatiotemporal parameters more than when loads were placed high on the back. The findings on spatiotemporal parameters indicate that a reduction in gait velocity and cadence and an increase in double support time for the 20% lower configuration could be a compensatory mechanism for children to minimize either the induced gait instability or mechanical strain on the musculoskeletal system in terms of possible higher lower limb joint moments or both. Results also showed higher forward trunk lean for dynamic conditions compared to static conditions indicating differences in strategies employed to maintain balance for static and dynamic conditions.

AB  - AIMS: The main aim of this study was to assess dermal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and airway exposure to PAHs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs; benzene and 1,3-butadiene), and particles among firefighters (FFs) and police forensic investigators (PFIs) in Sweden. METHODS: Active (pump with a filter and sorbent tube) and passive (polyurethane foam -cyl and perkin elmer carbopack-tube) personal air sampling and dermal tape stripping (wrist and collar bone) were performed on seven FF team leaders during training fires and nine PFIs investigating the aftermath of live fire events. In addition, passive personal air sampling was performed on eight FF team leaders during live emergency fires. PAHs and VOCs were analysed using high-resolution gas chromatography low-resolution mass spectrometry. The mass concentration of total dust (particles) was determined using standard gravimetric methods. RESULTS: The air samples showed that the exposure to PAHs, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and particles was below Swedish occupational exposure limits (OELs). Naphthalene was the predominant PAH in all air samples. Benzene and 1,3-butadiene were more abundant in live emergency fires, which caused higher exposures than the other studied situations. Both gaseous- and particle-associated PAHs were present on skin. The wrists seemed to be less well protected than the collarbone area. CONCLUSIONS: FFs and PFIs are exposed to several hazardous compounds during their work. Air exposures varied considerably between working scenarios. The observed exposures were substantially higher than urban background levels but well below Swedish OELs. The measured dermal PAH exposures were comparable to previously reported doses for US FFs but lower than the exposures reported for Swedish chimney sweeps.

AB  - ABSTRACT Purpose We recently presented an integrating model of the curvature constant of the hyperbolic power–time relationship (W′) that permits the calculation of the W′ balance (W′BAL) remaining at any time during intermittent exercise. Although a relationship between recovery power and the rate of W′ recovery was demonstrated, the effect of the length of work or recovery intervals remains unclear. Methods After determining V˙O2max, critical power, and W′, 11 subjects completed six separate exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on different days, and in random order. Tests consisted of a period of intermittent severe-intensity exercise until the subject depleted approximately 50% of their predicted W′BAL, followed by a constant work rate (CWR) exercise bout until exhaustion. Work rates were kept constant between trials; however, either work or recovery durations during intermittent exercise were varied. The actual W′ measured during the CWR (W′ACT) was compared with the amount of W′ predicted to be available by the W′BAL model. Results Although some differences between W′BAL and W′ACT were noted, these amounted to only −1.6 ± 1.1 kJ when averaged across all conditions. The W′ACT was linearly correlated with the difference between V˙O2 at the start of CWR and V˙O2max (r = 0.79, P < 0.01). Conclusions The W′BAL model provided a generally robust prediction of CWR W′. There may exist a physiological optimum formulation of work and recovery intervals such that baseline V˙O2 can be minimized, leading to an enhancement of subsequent exercise tolerance. These results may have important implications for athletic training and racing.

Tests consisted of a period of intermittent severe-intensity exercise until the subject depleted approximately 50% of their predicted W′BAL, followed by a constant work rate (CWR) exercise bout until exhaustion. Work rates were kept constant between trials; however, either work or recovery durations during intermittent exercise were varied.

AB  - Given the importance of body composition in maintaining optimal physical and functional capacities, the use of appropriate, field-based assessment tools should be a priority to assist in maintaining the occupational safety of firefighters and the community. For ease, body mass index (BMI) has often been used to assess these changes. However, it is limited in its accuracy. The purposes of this study were twofold; 1) to compare the validity of different measures of body composition against dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in urban firefighters and 2) to assess these measures in their ability to provide meaningful interpretation of criteria-driven categories of adiposity. Sixty-four male Firefighters (age 44.0+/-9.5 years) underwent full anthropometric profiling (predictor equations used to determine body fat % (BF%)), bio-impedance analysis (BIA) and DXA assessments. Participants' BMI was calculated and BF % and lean mass were determined along with criteria-driven categorisations of adiposity. Anthropometric (skinfolds) predictor equations (e.g. mean bias -4.4 % for BF%) were typically closer to DXA measures, compared to BIA (9.4% for BF%). However, when determining categories of criteria-driven adiposity, BIA (42.9% overweight or obese) provided closer estimates to the DXA determined-distribution (44.6%) than anthropometric based measures (up to 40%). BMI appears an inappropriate measure for accurately determining categories of adiposity with 64.1% classified as overweight or obese. Given the logistical constraints of anthropometric profiling, and the closeness of BIA to DXA in adiposity categories, BIA may be a suitable alternative to DXA for assessing body composition in professional urban firefighters.

AB  - Ten men (non-firefighters) completed a 110 min walking/recovery protocol (three 20-min exercise bouts, with recovery periods of 10, 20, and 20 min following successive bouts) in a thermoneutral laboratory while wearing firefighting personal protective equipment over one of four base layers: cotton, modacrylic, wool, and phase change material. There were no significant differences in changes in heart rate, core temperature, rating of perceived exertion, thermal discomfort, and thermal strain among base layers. Sticking to skin, coolness/hotness, and clothing humidity sensation were more favorable (p < 0.05) for wool compared with cotton; no significant differences were identified for the other 7 clothing sensations assessed. Separate materials performance testing of the individual base layers and firefighting ensembles (base layer + turnout gear) indicated differences in thermal protective performance and total heat loss among the base layers and among ensembles; however, differences in heat dissipation did not correspond with physiological responses during exercise or recovery.

AB  - Firefighting is a hazardous profession which has claimed on average the lives of 105 US firefighters per year for the past decade. The leading cause of line-of-duty mortality is sudden cardiac death, which accounts for approximately 45% of all firefighter duty-related fatalities. Strenuous physical activity, emotional stress, and environmental pollutants all strain the cardiovascular system, and each can increase the risk of sudden cardiac events in susceptible individuals. Sudden cardiac death is more likely to occur during or shortly after emergency duties such as fire suppression, despite the fact that these duties comprise a relatively small proportion of firefighters' annual duties. Additionally, cardiac events are more likely to occur in firefighters who possess an excess of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease along with underlying atherosclerosis and/or structural heart disease. In this review, we propose a theoretical model for the interaction between underlying cardiovascular disease in firefighters and the multifactorial physiological strain of firefighting.

AB  - Blood chemistry and immune cell parameters were examined in firefighters in a 1-week program of “live fire” training exercises. Blood samples were obtained at the beginning (AM) and end (PM) of each of the last 4 days of training. Analyses revealed significant time (AM-to-PM) effects for of the blood chemistry and immune variables along with significant leukocytosis over the 4 days of training. Despite the significant changes, these data suggest that serial days of supervised firefighting training do not appear to cause dangerous changes in blood chemistry or immunosuppression.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of personal protective equipment (PPE) on cardiovascular and metabolic responses during incremental exercise, and to determine if PPE affects the relationship between heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake when expressed as the chronotropic index (CI). Ten male participants performed graded exercise tests under three conditions: control (CON), (PPE) and weighted vest (WV) (same weight as PPE). Time to exhaustion was significantly longer in the CON compared to the other conditions (p < 0.01). Submaximal oxygen uptake and HR were significantly lower in the CON compared to the PPE and WV conditions. The CI (CON, 32.2 ± 4.5; PPE, 31.7 ± 5.7; WV, 32.6 ± 4.9) was similar in all three conditions. This study has shown that additional weight and encapsulating clothing leads to elevations in HR and oxygen uptake compared to a control condition, however, the CI remains unaffected. Practitioner Summary: Firefighters wear personal protective equipment that is designed to protect the wearer; however it also imposes a physiological burden. It is known that work in firefighting PPE increases cardiovascular and metabolic strain. This study has shown that PPE does not alter the relationship between heart rate and oxygen uptake.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sudden cardiac events account for 40% to 50% of firefighter line-of-duty deaths. Inflammatory proteins are strong biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation. The present study investigated the effects of aspirin supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers following firefighting. METHODS: Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design, 24 male firefighters (48.2 +/- 5.9 years) were allocated into four conditions: acute (81 mg; single-dose) aspirin and placebo supplementation, and chronic (81 mg; 14 days) aspirin and placebo supplementation. Inflammatory proteins [interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, P-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)] and antioxidant potential [total antioxidant capacity (TAC)] were measured pre- and post-structural firefighting drills. RESULTS: Firefighting activities significantly increased IL-6, MMP-9, and P-Selectin; however, no changes in TAC and ICAM-1 were detected. Neither acute nor chronic aspirin supplementation attenuated this inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Firefighting significantly increases inflammatory biomarkers and neither acute nor chronic low-dose aspirin mitigates this response.

AB  - A physiological status monitor (PSM) has been embedded in a fire-resistant shirt. The purpose of this research study was to examine the ability of the PSM-shirt to accurately detect heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) when worn under structural fire fighting personal protective equipment (PPE) during the performance of various activities relevant to fire fighting. Eleven healthy, college-aged men completed three activities (walking, searching/crawling, and ascending/descending stairs) that are routinely performed during fire fighting operations while wearing the PSM-shirt under structural fire fighting PPE. Heart rate and RR recorded by the PSM-shirt were compared to criterion values measured concurrently with an ECG and portable metabolic measurement system, respectively. For all activities combined (overall) and for each activity, small differences were found between the PSM-shirt and ECG (mean difference [95% CI]: overall: -0.4 beats/min [-0.8, -0.1]; treadmill: -0.4 beats/min [-0.7, -0.1]; search: -1.7 beats/min [-3.1, -.04]; stairs: 0.4 beats/min [0.04, 0.7]). Standard error of the estimate was 3.5 beats/min for all tasks combined and 1.9, 5.9, and 1.9 beats/min for the treadmill walk, search, and stair ascent/descent, respectively. Correlations between the PSM-shirt and criterion heart rates were high (r = 0.95 to r = 0.99). The mean difference between RR recorded by the PSM-shirt and criterion overall was 1.1 breaths/min (95% CI: -1.9 to -0.4). The standard error of the estimate for RR ranged from 4.2 breaths/min (treadmill) to 8.2 breaths/min (search), with an overall value of 6.2 breaths/min. These findings suggest that the PSM-shirt provides valid measures of HR and useful approximations of RR when worn during fire fighting duties.

AB  - Background Sudden cardiac death accounts for the greatest proportion of duty-related deaths among US firefighters. Increased understanding of the pathoanatomic causes of sudden cardiac death and the risk associated with underlying cardiac pathologies is needed to develop evidence-based screening recommendations. Methods and Results Using autopsy data for duty-related firefighter fatalities occurring between 1999 and 2014, this retrospective case-control study compared cardiac findings of male firefighters aged 18 to 65 years who died on duty of cardiac-related causes with those who died of noncardiac trauma-related causes. Data from 276 cardiac cases and 351 noncardiac trauma controls were analyzed. Among cardiac cases, the most prevalent (82%) underlying pathoanatomic substrate was comorbid coronary heart disease and cardiomegaly/left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac cases had a higher prevalence of cardiomegaly (heart weight >450 g), left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular wall thickness ≥1.2 cm), and severe coronary artery stenosis (≥75%) than trauma controls (all P<0.001). In multivariate analyses, heart weight >450 g, coronary artery stenosis ≥75%, and evidence of a prior myocardial infarction were strong independent predictors of cardiac death, with odds ratios of 6.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-10.4), 9.3 (95% confidence interval, 5.3-16.1), and 6.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.4-11.3), respectively. Conclusions The majority of cardiac fatalities had evidence of both coronary heart disease and increased heart mass, and each condition was independently associated with a markedly elevated risk of cardiac death. Targeted screening for coronary heart disease, increased heart mass, and evidence of prior myocardial infarction should be considered to reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters.

AB  - Objective: Firefighting-related environmental and physiological factors associated with cardiovascular strain may promote arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, which induce sudden cardiac events (SCE) in susceptible individuals. The present study evaluated electrocardiographic (ECG) changes that may reflect increased SCE risk following simulated live-firefighting. Methods: Using a repeated measures design, ECG tracings from 32 firefighters were recorded 12-hours post-firefighting in a residential structure and compared with a 12-hour control period. Results: Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 20%, and ST segment changes indicative of myocardial ischemia in 16%, of firefighters 12-hours post-firefighting that were not detected in the control period. Conclusion: Live-firefighting induces significant ECG changes that include ventricular arrhythmias and ST segment changes, which may reflect myocardial ischemia. The implications of such ECG changes explaining increased cardiovascular risk in firefighters warrants further research.

AB  - Approximately 45%-50% of all duty-related deaths among firefighters are due to sudden cardiovascular events, and a disproportionate number of these fatalities occur after strenuous fire suppression activities. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of strenuous firefighting activities on platelets, coagulation, and fibrinolytic activity and to document the extent to which these variables recovered 2 h after completion of the firefighting activity. METHODS: Firefighters performed 18 min of simulated firefighting activities in a training structure that contained live fires. After firefighting activities, firefighters were provided with fluid and allowed to cool down and then recovered for 2 h in an adjacent room. Blood samples were obtained prefirefighting, postfirefighting, and 2 h postfirefighting. RESULTS: Platelet number, platelet activity, and coagulatory potential increased immediately postfirefighting and many variables (platelet function, partial thromboplastin time, and factor VIII) reflected a procoagulatory state even after 2 h of recovery. Fibrinolysis, as reflected by tissue plasminogen activator, also was enhanced immediately postfirefighting but returned to baseline values by 2 h postfirefighting. In contrast, inhibition of fibrinolysis, as evidenced by a reduction in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, was depressed at 2 h postfirefighting. CONCLUSIONS: Firefighting resulted in elevated coagulatory and fibrinolytic activity. However, 2 h postfirefighting, tissue plasminogen activator returned to baseline and coagulatory potential remained elevated. The procoagulatory state that exists after firefighting may provide a mechanistic link to the reports of sudden cardiac events after strenuous fire suppression activities.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity and firefighting activities on coagulation and fibrinolytic activity in relatively young, apparently healthy firefighters. Firefighters performed simulated firefighting activities for 18 minutes in a live-fire training structure. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, before firefighting, and within a few minutes of completing the activity. Nearly all markers of coagulation and fibrinolytic activity increased immediately after firefighting with an overall shift toward a procoagulatory profile. Obese firefighters exhibited lower levels of tissue plasminogen activator activity (0.98 vs 0.63 IU/ml) and higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity (2.2 vs 4.5 ng/ml) at baseline compared with normal-weight firefighters, suggesting that fibrinolytic activity was lower in obese firefighters. There were few interactions between body mass index and firefighting activity, thus our findings suggest that obese firefighters did not exhibit a greater procoagulatory response to live firefighting compared with normal-weight firefighters. Acute live firefighting produced increases in both fibrinolytic and coagulatory responses; although obesity was associated with a reduced fibrinolytic profile at baseline, the changes produced by acute firefighting were similar in obese and nonobese firefighters.

AB  - The study examined the effects of repeated strenuous live-fire drills on cardiovascular and psychological responses of male recruit firefighters (n = 7). Participants performed three trials of a standardized set of tasks while inside a training structure containing several live fires. Measurements of heart rate, aortic blood flow, perceived exertion, respiratory and thermal distress, reaction time, and error rate were obtained before testing, after each trial and during recovery. Heart rate increased significantly during each of the trials, reaching age-predicted maximal values. Stroke volume was significantly lower after trial 3 versus trial 1 and prevalues. Perceived exertion, respiratory distress, and thermal distress all increased, indicating greater stress following firefighting activities. Reaction time and error rate did not change significantly, but there was a tendency for more errors following trials 2 and 3 versus trial 1. The training drills resulted in considerable physiological and psychological strain, which has the potential to impair cognitive function. Firefighters are encouraged to take all possible steps to mitigate the extent of the cardiovascular strain.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine selected physiological and psychological responses to strenuous live-fire drills in different configurations of protective firefighting gear. Career firefighters (n = 10) performed three sets of firefighting drills in a training structure that contained live fires in two different configurations of firefighting gear. On separate days subjects wore: (a) the NFPA 1500 (1987) standard configuration, and (b) a hip-boot configuration of the firefighting gear. Physiological and psychological measurements were recorded pre-activity and at the end of each trial. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a strong trend for performance time to be greater in the 1500 gear than in the hip-boot gear. There was a significant Time x Gear interaction for tympanic membrane temperature, with temperature being greater in the 1500 gear. Perceptions of effort and thermal sensations were also greater in the 1500 gear than in the hip-boot configuration of the gear. There was little difference in mean performance on cognitive function measures between the two gear configurations, but there was greater variability in performance in the 1500 gear. These data suggest that performing strenuous firefighting drills in the current NFPA 1500 standard configuration results in longer performance time, greater thermal strain, and greater perception of effort and thermal sensation.

AB  - This study describes the effects of strenuous live-fire fire fighting drills and 90min of recovery on hematological and psychological variables. Eleven fire fighters performed three trials of fire fighting tasks in a training structure that contained live fires. Plasma volume decreased immediately following the drill, but returned to baseline following recovery and aggressive rehydration. Blood glucose and sodium concentrations were significantly lower than pre-test, or immediately post-fire fighting values, after recovery. Perceptual variables all increased during fire fighting activities. These data emphasize the need for aggressive fluid replacement following fire fighting activity, and indicate that carbohydrate/electrolyte replacement may be beneficial prior to subsequent activity.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of strenuous live-fire firefighting drills and a 90 min recovery period on selected hormonal, immunological and psychological variables. Apparently healthy, male, professional firefighters (n = 11) performed three trials of standardized firefighting tasks in a live-fire training structure. There was significant leukocytosis immediately post firefighting activity that persisted following recovery, although there was a variable response among the leukocyte subsets. Most notable was the decrease in number and percentage of lymphocytes following 90 min of recovery. Plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol were significantly elevated post firefighting activity and cortisol remained elevated following 90 min of recovery. Elevated cortisol immediately following activity was related to reduced feelings of energy. These data demonstrate the magnitude of the physiological and psychological disruption following strenuous firefighting activity and suggest that immune function may be altered following such activity. This is a finding that may have practical consequences for this group of first responders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The leading cause of line-of-duty death among firefighters is sudden cardiac events. Platelets play a critical role in the formation of an occlusive thrombus during an ischemic event. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effect of firefighting on platelet number and aggregability. METHODS: Apparently healthy male firefighters (N = 114; age 29.4 +/- 7.8 years) participated in 18 minutes of simulated firefighting activity in a training structure that contained live fires. Blood samples were obtained before and after simulated firefighting activity and analyzed for complete blood cell count (CBC), chemistry, and platelet number and function. Platelet function was measured using a PFA-100 analyzer to assess platelet aggregability. RESULTS: As expected, performing firefighting activity resulted in significant increases in heart rate (75 b.min(-1)) and core temperature (0.7 degrees C), and significant changes in blood chemistry values. The most important finding in this study is that 18 minutes of simulated firefighting caused a 24% increase in platelet number and a significant increase in platelet aggregability. CONCLUSIONS: Firefighting resulted in a significant increase in platelet number and aggregability, indicating that even short bouts of firefighting can increase thrombotic potential in apparently healthy firefighters.

AB  - This study was designed to describe the physiological, psychophysical, and psychological responses of firefighters to firefighting drills in a training structure containing live fires. Fifteen male firefighters, wearing standard turnout gear which resulted in full encapsulation, performed two firefighting tasks (advancing fire hose, chopping wood) while inside the training structure. Measurements of heart rate, tympanic membrane temperature, blood lactate, perceptions of respiration, mood, perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were obtained after 8 min of advancing fire hose, and again after 8 min of chopping. Heart rate and temperature increased significantly from baseline and from advancing hose to wood chopping, whereas blood lactate increased initially after advancing the hose and remained elevated at the end of the chopping task. At the completion of the test (both tasks), mean heart rate (182.3 b.min-1), temperature (40.1 degrees C, [104.1 degrees F]), and blood lactate (3.8 mMol) suggested that the firefighting tasks used in this study impose considerable physiological strain on firefighters. Psychophysical and psychological data mirrored the greater physiological strain following firefighting tasks performed in a hot environment while wearing full turnout gear.

AB  - Little is known about the impact of thermoregulatory demands on cardiovascular and psychological responses of firefighters during firefighting activities. This study examined selected responses to a training drill in different thermal environments. Male firefighters (n = 16) were randomly assigned to perform a simulated ceiling overhaul task for 16 min in either a neutral (13.7 degrees C) or hot (89.6 degrees C) condition while wearing standard firefighting turnout gear. Physiological and psychological measures were assessed before, after 8 min and 16 min of firefighting activity, and following a 10-min recovery period. The variables assessed included heart rate (HR), tympanic temperature (Ttymp), lactate level (LAC), blood glucose level, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), perceptions of respiration, thermal sensations (TS) and state anxiety (SA). Significant increases were seen for HR, Ttymp, LAC, RPE and SA, with the increases being much greater following the hot condition. Recovery was significantly slower following work in the hot condition. These findings suggest that the addition of a live fire (a common situation for firefighters) contributes to increased cardiovascular and psychological strain at a standardized workload.

AB  - Traditionally, the estimation of oxygen consumption (VO2) at work using heart rate (HR) has required the determination of individual HR/VO2 calibration curves in a separate exercise test in a laboratory (VO2-TRAD). Recently, a new neural network-, and heart rate variability-based method has been developed (Firstbeat PRO heartbeat analysis software) for the estimation of VO2 without individual calibration (VO2-HRV). In the present study, the VO2-values by the VO2-HRV were compared with the values by VO2-TRAD in 22 postal workers. Within individuals the correlation between the two methods was high (range 0.80-0.99). The VO2-TRAD gave higher values of VO2 compared to VO2-HRV (19%) especially during low physical activity work when non-metabolic factors may increase HR. When assessed in different HR categories, the smallest difference (11%), and highest correlations (range 0.83-0.99) in VO2 between the methods were observed at higher HR levels. The results indicate that the VO2-HRV is a potentially useful method to estimate VO2 in the field without laboratory calibration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of long work shifts and turnout gear, including the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) on firefighters' postural stability. METHODS: Sixteen firefighters were assessed using a portable forceplate system at the fire station. Postural sway parameters were recorded at the beginning of the work shift and repeated until the work shift ended. RESULTS: Task had the greatest impact on postural stability for all sway parameters. Turnout gear, with and without SCBA, improved postural stability. Postural stability decreased as firefighters spent more time on duty. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged work shifts may be an important contributor to the high prevalence of slips and falls among firefighters. In all, the results indicate that many aspects of the firefighters' job may adversely impact their postural stability and potentially increase the risk of falling.

AB  - This study aimed to ascertain the appropriate test methods for the investigation of the effect of personal protective equipment on mobility of firefighters. Nine male volunteers performed a physical performance test (crawl, obstacle course, side-to-side jumps, heavy-object drag, and step-ups), functional balance test (functional reach, timed up and go, and wooden plank time), range of motion test, and subjective evaluation under four clothing conditions with different weights and combinations of personal protective equipment. The results showed that physical performance, functional balance ability, and joint angles significantly declined with increased weight of personal protective equipment. On subjective evaluation, wearing heavy personal protective equipment increased perceived exertion and discomfort on movement. Our results proved that some of our test methods, including the obstacle course, side-to-side jumps, functional reach, timed up and go, range of motion test, and subjective evaluation, can be used to examine the mobility of personal protective equipment wearers. The findings of this study provide an effective guide for researchers and firefighters regarding the evaluation of mobility with personal protective equipment, as well as for manufacturers in the development of enhanced, comfortable personal protective equipment.

AB  - Sudden death is an important but widely under-recognised consequence of stroke. Acute stroke can disturb central autonomic control, resulting in myocardial injury, electrocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and ultimately sudden death. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that autonomic imbalance is more frequent after infarcts involving the insular cortex, a crucial region for the control of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functions. Cardiovascular comorbidities increase the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality after stroke. Thus, many sudden deaths and serious non-fatal cardiac events after stroke are probably due to an interaction between cardiovascular and neurological causes. The exact mechanisms leading to sudden death remain incompletely understood. Further research is needed to investigate the autonomic consequences of acute stroke and to identify patients at high risk of sudden death.

AB  - Abnormalities in gait kinematics in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) who have mild disability have been noted using motion capture systems. However, it is not clear if these abnormalities can be detected with clinically feasible technology. This investigation examined if the spatiotemporal markers of gait including variability metrics can distinguish between PwMS with minimal disability and controls with clinically feasible technology. 43 PwMS with minimal disability and 43 healthy controls completed four walking trials along a 26 foot long pressure sensitive pathway (GAITRite). Spatiotemporal markers of gait including variability metrics were determined. Statistical analysis revealed that PwMS walked slower, with fewer, shorter, wider steps and spent a greater percentage of a gait cycle in double support than controls. Additionally, PwMS had greater variability in the time between steps, single support percent and step width than controls. Collectively, the results highlight that PwMS, in the absence of clinical gait impairment, have subtle but detectable differences in gait and that these alterations can be detected with clinically feasible technology. The current results raise the possibility of targeting walking deviations earlier in disability progression in PwMS.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of on-duty death among firefighters (45% of on-duty fatalities) and a major cause of morbidity. CVD in the fire service also has adverse public safety implications as well as significant cost impacts on government agencies. Over the last decade, our understanding of CVD among firefighters has significantly improved and provides insight into potential preventive strategies. The physiology of cardiovascular arousal and other changes that occur in association with acute firefighting activities have been well-characterized. However, despite the strenuous nature of emergency duty, firefighters' prevalence of low fitness, obesity, and other CVD risk factors are high. Unique statistical approaches have documented that on-duty CVD events do not occur at random in the fire service. They are more frequent at certain times of day, certain periods of the year, and are overwhelmingly more frequent during strenuous duties compared with nonemergency situations. Moreover, as expected on-duty CVD events occur almost exclusively among susceptible firefighters with underlying CVD. These findings suggest that preventive measures with proven benefits be applied aggressively to firefighters. Furthermore, all fire departments should have entry-level medical evaluations, institute periodic medical and fitness evaluations, and require rigorous return to work evaluations after any significant illness. Finally, on the basis of the overwhelming evidence supporting markedly higher relative risks of on-duty death and disability among firefighters with established coronary heart disease, most firefighters with clinically significant coronary heart disease should be restricted from participating in strenuous emergency duties.

AB  - Ten male firefighters were tested on a treadmill to determine their heart rate (HR) x oxygen consumption (VO2) relationship. These men then performed a simulated fire suppression protocol during which HR and VO2 were measured simultaneously by a portable physiological monitoring system. Average VO2 in the simulated setting was 31.0 +/- 7.0 ml.kg-1.min-1 at a HR of 176 +/- 9 bpm. This VO2 was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) less than the VO2 that would have been predicted by treadmill testing (38.9 +/- 5.0 ml.kg-1.min-1) at a corresponding HR. Fifty-nine per cent of this variability could be accounted for by regression analysis. Firefighters worked on average at 73 +/- 10% VO2 max with a range of 54% to 88%. There was a significant (-0.82; p less than or equal to 0.05) inverse relationship between performance time of the fire suppression protocol and the relative intensity of VO2 max at which the firefighters worked. These findings indicate that the prediction of energy expenditure from HR is not straightforward in fire suppression settings. Furthermore, the relative intensity of work firefighters self-select is variable and should be considered as an additional physiological determinant of work behaviour.

AB  - Employment rights legislative mandates passed in the USA over the last three decades emphasize the importance of validating performance standards for physically strenuous occupations. This study validated minimally acceptable standards for the muscular strength and endurance necessary to perform fire suppression activities. Incumbent firefighters (n=153) selected for key demographic characteristics completed a simulated set of firefighting tasks (Fire Suppression Evolution) and then a Predictor Test Battery of physical abilities tests. Regression analysis revealed that three predictor test items (hose drag/high rise pack carry; arm lift; arm endurance) combined to significantly predict performance time of the Fire Suppression Evolution (p < or =0.01). Firefighters (n=41) rating videotaped performance times of the Fire Suppression Evolution determined that more than one-half a standard deviation slower than the mean time established by the incumbents reflected unacceptable performance. Approximately 80% of incumbent firefighters passed the minimally acceptable performance standard. Use of the 3-predictor test battery would correctly identify 89% of successful performers and 72% of unsuccessful performers. This study demonstrates that validation of minimal physical performance standards will identify a cohort of individuals with a high probability of not being able to perform critical fire suppression activities. This finding has important implications for examining the relationship between physical performance standards and medical and economic outcomes.

AB  - Heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption (VO2) responses during actual fire-suppression emergencies were monitored in 10 male firefighters. These firefighters worked at 157 +/- 8 beats per minute (bpm) for 15 +/- 7 minutes. This was 88 +/- 6% of their previously determined HR max. Based on treadmill testing, the HR x VO2 relationship was established for each firefighter. The predicted VO2 derived from HR monitoring in actual emergencies was 25.6 +/- 8.7 mL.kg-1.min-1 or 63 +/- 14% of VO2 max (40.0 +/- 6.5 mL.kg-1.min-1). These values on the cardiorespiratory response to actual emergencies are very similar to results derived from studies employing fire-suppression simulations. Recommendations for the VO2 max of firefighters ranging from 33.5 to 42.0 mL.kg-1.min-1 that have been generated from simulation testing appear appropriate given the cardiorespiratory responses to actual emergencies.

AB  - Heat is a major stressor during exercise, though its value in driving adaptation is not well understood. Muscle heating can upregulate pathways facilitating protein synthesis and could thereby enhance effects of exercise training, however, few studies have investigated this possibility. We examined whether heating active muscle during resistance training differentially affected physical and functional adaptations. Within a randomised contralateral-limb control study, ten healthy, resistance-untrained individuals (21 ± 3 y; 5 female) completed 30 sessions of progressive resistance training (12 weeks), performing 4 × 8 unilateral knee extensions at 70% of 1RM. One randomly-allocated thigh was heated during, and for 20 min after, each session using an electric pad eliciting muscle temperatures of >38 °C (HOT); the contralateral limb remained unheated (CON). Training intensity was progressed using 4-weekly strength assessments. Quadricep lean mass (measured using DXA) increased by 15 ± 7% in HOT (p = 0.00) and 15 ± 6% in CON (p = 0.00); the difference being trivial (p = 0.94). Peak isokinetic torque at 90°.s(-1) increased by 30 ± 25% (HOT; p = 0.00) and 34 ± 33% (CON; p = 0.01), with no difference (p = 0.84) between limbs. Rate of torque development increased ∼40%, with no difference between limbs (p = 0.73). The increase in 3-RM strength was also similar in HOT (75 ± 16%) and CON (71 ± 14%; p = 0.80 for difference). No differences in mass or strength changes were evident between sexes. In conclusion, supplemental heating of active muscle during and after each bout of resistance training showed no clear positive (or negative) effect on training-induced hypertrophy or function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether full-scale simulation (SIM) is superior to interactive problem-based learning (PBL) for teaching medical students acute care assessment and management skills. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Simulation center at a U.S. medical school. SUBJECTS: Thirty-one fourth-year medical students in a week-long acute care course. INTERVENTIONS: After institutional review board approval and informed consent, eligible students were randomized to either the SIM or PBL group. On day 1, all subjects underwent a simulator-based initial assessment designed to evaluate their critical care skills. Two blinded investigators assessed each student using a standardized checklist. Subsequently, the PBL group learned about dyspnea in a standard PBL format. The SIM group learned about dyspnea using the simulator. To equalize simulator education time, the PBL group learned about acute abdominal pain on the simulator, whereas the SIM group used the PBL format. On day 5, each student was tested on a unique dyspnea scenario. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean initial assessment and final assessment checklist scores and their change for the SIM and PBL groups were compared using the Student's t-test. A p < .05 was considered significant. The SIM and PBL groups had similar mean (PBL 0.44, SIM 0.47, p = .64) initial assessment scores (earned score divided by maximum score) and were deemed equivalent. The SIM group performed better than the PBL group on the final assessment (mean, PBL 0.53, SIM 0.72, p < .0001). When each student's change in score (percent correct on final assessment minus percent correct on the initial assessment) was compared, SIM group students performed better (mean improvement, SIM 25 percentage points vs. PBL 8 percentage points, p < .04) CONCLUSIONS: For fourth-year medical students, simulation-based learning was superior to problem-based learning for the acquisition of critical assessment and management skills.

AB  - Cancer incidence appears to be higher amongst firefighters compared to the general population. Given that many cancers have an environmental component, their occupational exposure to products of carbon combustion such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is of concern. This is the first UK study identifying firefighters exposure to PAH carcinogens. Wipe samples were collected from skin (jaw, neck, hands), personal protective equipment of firefighters, and work environment (offices, fire stations and engines) in two UK Fire and Rescue Service Stations. Levels of 16 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PAHs were quantified together with more potent carcinogens: 7,12-dimethylbenzo[a]anthracene, and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA) (12 months post-initial testing). Cancer slope factors, used to estimate cancer risk, indicate a markedly elevated risk. PAH carcinogens including benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 3-MCA, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene PAHs were determined on body surfaces (e.g., hands, throat), on PPE including helmets and clothing, and on work surfaces. The main exposure route would appear to be via skin absorption. These results suggest an urgent need to monitor exposures to firefighters in their occupational setting and conduct long-term follow-up regarding their health status.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The interpretation of patient scores on clinical tests of physical mobility is limited by a lack of data describing the range of performance among people without disabilities. The purpose of this study was to provide data for 4 common clinical tests in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. SUBJECTS: Ninety-six community-dwelling elderly people (61-89 years of age) with independent functioning performed 4 clinical tests. METHODS: Data were collected on the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MW), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up & Go Test (TUG) and during comfortable- and fast-speed walking (CGS and FGS). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the test-retest reliability for the 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements. Data were analyzed by gender and age (60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years) cohorts, similar to previous studies. Means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for each measurement were calculated for each cohort. RESULTS: The 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements showed high test-retest reliability (ICC [2,1]=.95-.97). Mean test scores showed a trend of age-related declines for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS, and FGS for both male and female subjects. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Preliminary descriptive data suggest that physical therapists should use age-related data when interpreting patient data obtained for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS and FGS. Further data on these clinical tests with larger sample sizes are needed to serve as a reference for patient comparisons.

AB  - Stress influences circulating inflammatory markers, and these effects may mediate the influence of psychosocial factors on cardiovascular risk and other conditions such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory responses can be investigated under controlled experimental conditions in humans, and evidence is beginning to emerge showing that circulating inflammatory factors respond to acute psychological stress under laboratory conditions. However, research published to date has varied greatly in the composition of study groups, the timing of samples, assay methods, and the type of challenge imposed. The purpose of this review is to synthesize existing data using meta-analytic techniques. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria. Results showed robust effects for increased levels of circulating IL-6 (r=0.19, p=0.001) and IL-1beta (r=0.58, p<0.001) following acute stress, and marginal effects for CRP (r=0.12, p=0.088). The effects of stress on stimulated cytokine production were less consistent. Significant variation in the inflammatory response was also related to the health status of participants and the timing of post-stress samples. A number of psychobiological mechanisms may underlie responses, including stress-induced reductions in plasma volume, upregulation of synthesis, or enlargement of the cell pool contributing to synthesis. The acute stress-induced inflammatory response may have implications for future health, and has become an important topic of psychoneuroimmunological research.

AB  - The rapid and effective response to a bioterrorist event requires the coordinated efforts of trained personnel from different agencies. This article describes the design and implementation of a 1-week cross-disciplinary course employing problem-based learning (PBL) for professionals with backgrounds in public health, fire/emergency medical services (EMS), law enforcement, emergency management, and hospital administration. The curriculum provided opportunities for professionals from different disciplines to meet and learn the priorities and resources of partner agencies. In course evaluations, participants rated the training highly and found it applicable to their work and a good use of time and training resources. PBL techniques were successful in fostering cross-agency communication, thereby showing promise as an effective training method for meeting local and national emergency preparedness objectives.

AB  - This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between energy expenditure and work rate on a bicycle ergometer in five sprinters and five distance runners who differed in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and type of training. Each subject performed at work rates of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 watts (W). The relationship between energy expenditure and work rates was most accurately described by a quadratic curve for both groups: for sprinters, energy expenditure (kJ) = 11.57 + 0.1812 (W) + 0.00046 (W)2; for distance runners, energy expenditure (kJ) = 11.74 + 0.1386 (W) + 0.00060 (W)2. Delta efficiency (delta work accomplished divided by delta energy expended X 100%) decreased as work rate increased. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in delta efficiency at the same work rate (P greater than 0.25) or at the same relative work rate (P greater than 0.75). These results suggest that differences in VO2max and/or type of training have little or no causal effect on the decrease in delta efficiency with increasing work rate. The observed decrease in delta efficiency may be due to increases in metabolism not directly related to the performance of the external work or to an increasing amount of unmeasured work as work rate increases on a bicycle ergometer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the influence of high exposure to bisphenol A on recurrent miscarriage and immunoendocrine abnormalities. METHODS: Serum bisphenol A, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), natural killer cell (NK) activity, prolactin, progesterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 were examined in 45 patients with a history of three or more (3-11) consecutive first-trimester miscarriages and 32 healthy women with no history of live birth and infertility. Subsequent pregnancy outcome and embryonic karyotype of abortuses were examined prospectively. RESULTS: The mean+/-SD values for bisphenol A in patients were 2.59+/-5.23 ng/ml, significantly higher than the 0.77+/-0.38 ng/ml found for control women (P=0.024). High exposure to bisphenol A was associated with the presence of ANAs but not hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia, luteal phase defects, NK cell activity or aPLs. A high level of bisphenol A in itself did not predict subsequent miscarriage. CONCLUSION: Exposure to bisphenol A is associated with recurrent miscarriage.

AB  - Lipid accumulation in the arterial wall is a crucial event in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major source of lipids that accumulate in the atherosclerotic plaques. It was discovered that not all LDL is atherogenic. In the blood plasma of atherosclerotic patients, LDL particles are the subject of multiple enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications that determine their atherogenicity. Desialylation is the primary and the most important atherogenic LDL modification followed by a cascade of other modifications that also increase blood atherogenicity. The enzyme trans-sialidase is responsible for the desialylation of LDL, therefore, its activity plays an important role in atherosclerosis development. Moreover, circulating modified LDL is associated with immune complexes that also have a strong atherogenic potential. Moreover, it was shown that antibodies to modified LDL are also atherogenic. The properties of modified LDL were described, and the strong evidence indicating that it is capable of inducing intracellular accumulation of lipids was presented. The accumulated evidence indicated that the molecular properties of modified LDL, including LDL-containing immune complexes can serve as the prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers and molecular targets for the development of anti-atherosclerotic drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the effects of trunk-muscle fatigue and blood lactic acid elevation on static and dynamic balance. INTERVENTION: Fatigue was induced by an isokinetic protocol, and static and dynamic balance were assessed during bilateral stance using a Kinesthetic Ability Trainer. Subjects participated in a fatigue protocol in which continuous concentric movements at 60 degrees/s were performed until the torque output for both trunk flexion and extension dropped below 25% of the calculated peak torque for 3 consecutive movements. MEASURES: Before and immediately after the fatigue protocol, blood lactic acid measurements and static- and dynamic-balance measurements were recorded. RESULTS: An increase in lactic acid levels was detected in all subjects. According to a dependent-samples t test, significant differences in balance and lactic acid values were found after the fatigue protocol. There was no correlation between lactic acid accumulation (change between prefatigue and postfatigue levels) and balance-score differences. CONCLUSION: Trunk-muscle fatigue has an adverse effect on static and dynamic balance.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To generate normal values for active range of motion (ACROM) of the cervical spine in asymptomatic persons. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a lack of normal values for ACROM based on large groups and stratified for different age categories. METHODS: Four hundred asymptomatic persons were included, 100 for each decade of age from 20 years to 60 years and in each subgroup 50 males and 50 females. ACROM was measured with the cervical range of motion (CROM) device. Analysis of variance and the Scheffe post hoc test was used to investigate the differences of ACROM between the decades of age. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of age and sex on ACROM. RESULTS: The results of this study show that the ACROM decreases significantly in persons older than 50 years for all directions except extension and side flexion compared with that in the subgroup aged 40 to 50. Age had an overall significant effect on the ACROM for all directions. Sex proved to have no significant effect on the ACROM. CONCLUSION: Normal values were established for ACROM in a group of 400 persons without neck complaints. It was demonstrated that age has a significant influence on the ACROM, but sex has no influence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.

AB  - The electric vehicle (EV) market, together with photovoltaic (PV) installations continues to develop at a pace. However, there are concerns that EV and PV installation fires may create more harmful substances than other types of fire. PV modules and car battery fires emit a range of carcinogenic and highly toxic compounds that are not yet fully understood and may pose a threat to firefighters' health. This also raises the question of the impact on firefighters' clothing and the safe handling and cleaning after such fires. This article presents a literature and standards review of the firefighters' protective clothing maintenance and cleaning. It also contains test results showing that firefighters' clothes accumulate harmful substances after fighting these types of fires. Pilot tests for the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and formaldehyde showed that levels exceeded limits in all clothing samples. For example, the cobalt level was 24 times higher than that considered safe in the test carried out with car battery fire. Although it is recognized that liquid carbon dioxide (LCO(2)) methods of cleaning may be more effective than traditional water washing, further research on cleaning efficiency for clothing containing substances emitted from car battery and PV modules fires is required.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We evaluated ophthalmic changes in healthy individuals who underwent integrated resistance and aerobic training (iRAT) during 70-d 6° head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest (BR). METHODS: Participants were selected using NASA standard screening procedures. Standardized NASA BR conditions were implemented. Subjects were randomly assigned to the iRAT protocol or no exercise during HDTBR. Weekly ophthalmic examinations were performed in the sitting (pre/post-BR only) and HDT (BR only) positions. Mixed-effects linear models compared pre- and post-HDTBR intraocular pressure (IOP), Spectralis OCT circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness, and peripapillary retinal thickness observations between groups. RESULTS: Six controls and nine exercisers completed the study. There was an overall effect of BR on our outcomes. Except Goldmann IOP (mean pre/post difference in controls and exercisers: -0.47 mmHg vs. +1.14 mmHg), the magnitude of changes from baseline was not significantly different between groups. There was a +1.38 mmHg and a +1.63 mmHg iCare IOP increase during BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Spectralis OCT detected a +1.33 μm average cpRNFL thickness increase in both groups, and a +9.77 μm and a +6.65 μm peripapillary retinal thickening post-BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Modified Amsler grid, red dot test, confrontational visual field, color vision, and stereoscopic fundus photography were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: HDTBR for 70 d induced peripapillary retinal thickening and cpRNFL thickening without visible signs of optic disc edema. The magnitude of such changes was not different between controls and exercisers. A slight IOP increase during BR subsided post-BR. Further study should evaluate whether different physical exercise paradigms may prevent/mitigate the risk of space-related visual impairment.Taibbi G, Cromwell RL, Zanello SB, Yarbough PO, Ploutz-Snyder RJ, Godley BF, Vizzeri G.

AB  - Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common side effect of most human diseases. Muscle loss is not only detrimental for the quality of life but it also dramatically impairs physiological processes of the organism and decreases the efficiency of medical treatments. While hypothesized for years, the existence of an atrophying programme common to all pathologies is still incompletely solved despite the discovery of several actors and key regulators of muscle atrophy. More than a decade ago, the discovery of a set of genes, whose expression at the mRNA levels were similarly altered in different catabolic situations, opened the way of a new concept: the presence of atrogenes, i.e. atrophy-related genes. Importantly, the atrogenes are referred as such on the basis of their mRNA content in atrophying muscles, the regulation at the protein level being sometimes more complicate to elucidate. It should be noticed that the atrogenes are markers of atrophy and that their implication as active inducers of atrophy is still an open question for most of them. While the atrogene family has grown over the years, it has mostly been incremented based on data coming from rodent models. Whether the rodent atrogenes are valid for humans still remain to be established. An “atrogene” was originally defined as a gene systematically up- or down-regulated in several catabolic situations. Even if recent works often restrict this notion to the up-regulation of a limited number of proteolytic enzymes, it is important to keep in mind the big picture view. In this review, we provide an update of the validated and potential rodent atrogenes and the metabolic pathways they belong, and based on recent work, their relevance in human physio-pathological situations. We also propose a more precise definition of the atrogenes that integrates rapid recovery when catabolic stimuli are stopped or replaced by anabolic ones.

AB  - Acute and long-term effects of resistance exercise combined with vascular occlusion on muscular function were investigated. Changes in integrated electromyogram with respect to time (iEMG), vascular resistive index, and plasma lactate concentration were measured in five men either during or after elbow flexion exercises with the proximal end of the arm occluded at 0-100 mmHg. The mean iEMG, postexercise hyperemia, and plasma lactate concentration were all elevated with the increase in occlusion pressure at a low-intensity exercise, whereas they were unchanged with the increase in occlusion pressure at high-intensity exercise. To investigate the long-term effects of low-intensity exercise with occlusion, older women (n = 24) were subjected to a 16-wk exercise training for elbow flexor muscles, in which low-intensity [ approximately 50-30% one repetition maximum (1 RM)] exercise with occlusion at approximately 110 mmHg (LIO), low-intensity exercise without occlusion (LI), and high- to medium-intensity ( approximately 80-50% 1 RM) exercise without occlusion (HI) were performed. Percent increases in both cross-sectional area and isokinetic strength of elbow flexor muscles after LIO were larger than those after LI (P < 0.05) and similar to those after HI. The results suggest that resistance exercise at an intensity even lower than 50% 1 RM is effective in inducing muscular hypertrophy and concomitant increase in strength when combined with vascular occlusion.

AB  - Humans are generally in standing or sitting positions on Earth during the day. The musculoskeletal system supports these positions and also allows motion. Gravity acting in the longitudinal direction of the body generates a hydrostatic pressure difference and induces footward fluid shift. The vestibular system senses the gravity of the body and reflexively controls the organs. During spaceflight or exposure to microgravity, the load on the musculoskeletal system and hydrostatic pressure difference is diminished. Thus, the skeletal muscle, particularly in the lower limbs, is atrophied, and bone minerals are lost via urinary excretion. In addition, the heart is atrophied, and the plasma volume is decreased, which may induce orthostatic intolerance. Vestibular-related control also declines; in particular, the otolith organs are more susceptible to exposure to microgravity than the semicircular canals. Using an advanced resistive exercise device with administration of bisphosphonate is an effective countermeasure against bone deconditioning. However, atrophy of skeletal muscle and the heart has not been completely prevented. Further ingenuity is needed in designing countermeasures for muscular, cardiovascular, and vestibular dysfunctions.

AB  - We have shown that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor can stimulate activation and early division of adult satellite cells in culture, and that the action of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor is similar to the action of the unidentified satellite cell activator found in extracts of crushed muscle. We now provide new evidence that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor is present in uninjured adult rat skeletal muscle and that the activating factor in crushed muscle extract is hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. Immunoblots of crushed muscle extract demonstrate the presence of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. Furthermore, crushed muscle extract stimulates the scattering of cultured MDCK cells. Immunolocalization studies with adult rat skeletal muscle show the presence of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor in the extracellular matrix surrounding muscle fibers; in addition, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, c-met, is localized to putative satellite cells. In muscle from mdx mice, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and c-met are colocalized in activated satellite cells in regions of muscle repair. Moreover, the satellite cell-activating activity of crushed muscle extract is abolished by preincubation with anti-hepatocyte growth factor antibodies. Finally, direct injection of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor into uninjured tibialis anterior muscle of 12-month-old rats stimulated satellite cell activation. These experiments demonstrate that hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor is present in muscle, can be released upon injury, and has the ability to activate quiescent satellite cells in vivo.

AB  - Load carriage increases physiological strain, reduces work capacity and elevates the risk of work-related injury. In this project, the separate and combined physiological consequences of wearing the personal protective equipment used by firefighters were evaluated. The overall impact upon performance was first measured in 20 subjects during a maximal, job-related obstacle course trial and an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion (with and without protective equipment). The fractional contributions of the thermal protective clothing, helmet, breathing apparatus and boots were then separately determined during steady-state walking (4.8 km h(-1), 0% gradient) and bench stepping (20 cm at 40 steps min(-1)). The protective equipment reduced exercise tolerance by 56% on a treadmill, with the ambulatory oxygen consumption reserve (peak minus steady-state walking) being 31% lower. For the obstacle course, performance declined by 27%. Under steady-state conditions, the footwear exerted the greatest relative metabolic impact during walking and bench stepping, being 8.7 and 6.4 times greater per unit mass than the breathing apparatus. Indeed, the relative influence of the clothing on oxygen cost was at least three times that of the breathing apparatus. Therefore, the most efficient way to reduce the physiological burden of firefighters' protective equipment, and thereby increase safety, would be to reduce the mass of the boots and thermal protective clothing.

AB  - Foot clearance is an important variable for understanding safe stair negotiation, but few studies have provided detailed measures of it. This paper presents a new method to calculate minimal shoe clearance during stair descent and compares it to previous literature. Seventeen healthy young subjects descended a five step staircase with step treads of 300 mm and step heights of 188 mm. Kinematic data were collected with an Optotrak system (model 3020) and three non-colinear infrared markers on the feet. Ninety points were digitized on the foot sole prior to data collection using a 6 marker probe and related to the triad of markers on the foot. The foot sole was reconstructed using the Matlab (version 7.0) "meshgrid" function and minimal distance to each step edge was calculated for the heel, toe and foot sole. Results showed significant differences in minimum clearance between sole, heel and toe, with the shoe sole being the closest and the toe the furthest. While the hind foot sole was closest for 69% of the time, the actual minimum clearance point on the sole did vary across subjects and staircase steps. This new method, and the findings on healthy young subjects, can be applied to future studies of other populations and staircase dimensions.

AB  - The glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), is believed to have an important function in modulating nutrient ingestion and metabolism. Recent evidence described in this review suggests that the effects of this adrenal hormone are mediated through two steroid receptor subtypes, the type I mineralocorticoid receptor and the type II glucocorticoid receptor. These receptors, which have different affinities for CORT, respond to different levels of circulating hormone. They mediate distinct effects of the steroid, which can be distinguished by the specific nutrient ingested and by the particular period of the circadian cycle. Under normal physiological conditions, the type I receptor is tonically activated, either by low basal levels of circulating CORT (0.5-2 microgram %) normally available across the circadian cycle or possibly by the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. This type I activation is required for the maintenance of fat ingestion and fat deposition that occurs during most meals of the feeding cycle. In contrast, the type II receptor is phasically activated by moderate levels of CORT (2-10 micrograms %) normally reached during the circadian peak. Activation of this receptor is required for the natural surge in carbohydrate ingestion and metabolism that is essential at the onset of the active feeding cycle when the body's glycogen stores are at their nadir, and gluconeogenesis is needed to maintain blood glucose levels. This receptor is also activated during periods of increased energy requirements, such as, after exercise and food restriction, when CORT levels rise further (> 10 micrograms %) and when its catabolic effects on fat and protein stores predominate to provide additional substrates for glucose homeostasis. These functions of CORT on fat and carbohydrate balance are mediated, in part, by type I and type II receptors located within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, which is known to have key functions in controlling nutrient intake and metabolism, as well as circulating CORT levels. Moreover, the type II receptors within this nucleus, in addition to the arcuate nucleus, may interact positively with the peptide, neuropeptide Y, and the catecholamine, norepinephrine, both of which act to enhance natural carbohydrate feeding and CORT release at the onset of the natural feeding cycle. Thus, under normal conditions, endogenous CORT has a primary function in controlling nutrient ingestion and metabolism over the natural circadian cycle, through the coordinated action of the type I and type II steroid receptor systems. Through this action, CORT has impact on total caloric intake and body weight gain over the long term.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles ("MISEV") guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these "MISEV2014" guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.

AB  - The original Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) offers a safe preliminary screening of candidates for exercise testing and prescription, but it screens out what seems an excessive proportion of apparently healthy older adults. To reduce unnecessary exclusions, an expert committee established by Fitness Canada has now revised the questionnaire wording. The present study compares responses to the original and the revised PAR-Q questionnaire in 399 men and women attending 40 accredited fitness testing centres across Canada. The number of subjects screened out by the revised test decreased significantly (p < .05), from 68 to 48 of the 399 subjects. The change reflects in part the inclusion of individuals who had made an erroneous positive response to the original question regarding high blood pressure. There is no simple gold standard to provide an objective evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of either questionnaire format, but the revised wording has apparently had the intended effect of reducing positive responses, particularly to the question regarding an elevation of blood pressure.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of fish oil supplementation on the magnitude and time-course of postresistance exercise muscle soreness. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Nonresistance trained females were randomized into one of two groups: fish oil supplementation (6 g/day; 5:1 eicosapentaenoic acid to docosahexaenoic acid (EPA:DHA)) or placebo (6 g/day corn/soy oil). After consuming the supplements for one week, participants underwent a single bout of resistance exercise consisting of 10 sets to failure of elbow flexion and leg extension machines. Muscle soreness was measured daily over the next week via grounded visual analog scale while participants continued to consume their assigned supplement. At 48 hours and one week postexercise, soreness during functional movements and limb circumferences were measured. The fish oil group perceived less static and functional muscle soreness than placebo, although the differences were not statistically significant. Effect sizes for resistance exercise-induced static and functional soreness responses were 33 to 42% lower in fish oil versus placebo without changes in upper arm and thigh circumferences. Supplementing the diet with 6 g per day of fish oil may alleviate muscle soreness experienced after resistance training in young untrained females.

AB  - Muscle protein breakdown (MPB) is an important metabolic component of muscle remodeling, adaptation to training, and increasing muscle mass. Degradation of muscle proteins occurs via the integration of three main systems-autophagy and the calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome systems. These systems do not operate independently, and the regulation is complex. Complete degradation of a protein requires some combination of the systems. Determination of MPB in humans is technically challenging, leading to a relative dearth of information. Available information on the dynamic response of MPB primarily comes from stable isotopic methods with expression and activity measures providing complementary information. It seems clear that resistance exercise increases MPB, but not as much as the increase in muscle protein synthesis. Both hyperaminoacidemia and hyperinsulinemia inhibit the post-exercise response of MPB. Available data do not allow a comprehensive examination of the mechanisms behind these responses. Practical nutrition recommendations for interventions to suppress MPB following exercise are often made. However, it is likely that some degree of increased MPB following exercise is an important component for optimal remodeling. At this time, it is not possible to determine the impact of nutrition on any individual muscle protein. Thus, until we can develop and employ better methods to elucidate the role of MPB following exercise and the response to nutrition, recommendations to optimize post exercise nutrition should focus on the response of muscle protein synthesis. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive examination of the state of knowledge, including methodological considerations, of the response of MPB to exercise and nutrition in humans.

AB  - Abstract:The aim of this review was to develop a test method for the evaluation of heat strain for structural firefighters wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in Japan. We analyzed a series of our laboratory?s questionnaires and experimental studies and reviewed international standards on test methods. We investigated the actual average working conditions (total firefighting time on one incidence, working time with full PPE, maximum temperature and humidity during firefighting) at structural firefighting site in Japan by conducting a large-scale questionnaire survey of Japanese firefighters. We discussed test subjects (firefighters vs. non-firefighters; body size; physical fitness), exercise intensity (absolutes vs. relative; light vs. heavy) and duration, experimental temperature and relative humidity, experimental clothing items including station uniforms (shorts vs. long), and measurement variables (physiological and subjective responses), and suggested a standard test method to evaluate the heat strain of firefighters in hot and humid environments.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A set of measurements was compared with an accepted gold standard using a methodologic design. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the criterion validity of the cervical range of motion device used for lateral flexion in patients with neck pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Reliability of the cervical range of motion device has been well established. At this writing, only validity for flexion and extension of the cervical spine has been investigated with this device. METHODS: The sample consisted of 24 volunteer subjects who had previously received physiotherapy for neck pain. In the radiograph department, subjects were stabilized on a chair. A first reading on the cervical range of motion device and a radiograph were taken in a neutral starting position. The subject then was asked to perform a maximal right lateral flexion, which was followed by a reading of the device and a second radiograph. The same procedures were followed for left lateral flexion. RESULTS: The cervical range of motion device demonstrated a very good linear relation with the radiograph measurements: left lateral flexion (r = 0.82,; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.92), right lateral flexion (r = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The cervical range of motion device showed very good validity for measurement of lateral flexion in this population of patients with neck pain. Because the reliability of the cervical range of motion device was established previously, the results of this study suggest that the device be used as an outcome measure for the cervical flexion, and for flexion and extension.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This study compared range of motion (ROM) measurements using a cervical range of motion device (CROM) and an optoelectronic system (OPTOTRAK). OBJECTIVES: To examine the criterion validity of the CROM for the measurement of cervical ROM on healthy adults. BACKGROUND: Whereas measurements of cervical ROM are recognized as part of the assessment of patients with neck pain, few devices are available in clinical settings. Two papers published previously showed excellent criterion validity for measurements of cervical flexion/extension and lateral flexion using the CROM. METHODS AND MEASURES: Subjects performed neck rotation, flexion/extension, and lateral flexion while sitting on a wooden chair. The ROM values were measured by the CROM as well as the OPTOTRAK. RESULTS: The cervical rotational ROM values using the CROM demonstrated a good to excellent linear relationship with those using the OPTOTRAK: right rotation, r = 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.94), and left rotation, r = 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.97). Similar results were also obtained for flexion/extension and lateral flexion ROM values. CONCLUSION: The CROM showed excellent criterion validity for measurements of cervical rotation. We propose using ROM values measured by the CROM as outcome measures for patients with neck pain.

AB  - A detailed description of a respiratory valve to measure oxygen uptake while swimming is given. The effect on body drag of the addition of this equipment was measured in four subjects swimming over a range of speeds (0.9-1.9 m s-1). The respiratory valve has a low airflow resistance (29 Pa at an airflow of 8 l X s-1) and a small deadspace (30 ml). Total body drag when swimming while wearing the respiratory equipment did not differ significantly from that when swimming without the equipment. It is concluded that this respiratory valve is ideal for making valid and reliable measurements of oxygen uptake during swimming.

AB  - There are currently important questions in the fire service as to the efficacy of various fire attack methods, both in terms of rapidly suppressing the fire and for potentially impacting the burn risk for occupants in the structure. A series of 24 full-scale residential fire experiments were performed to investigate the influence of fire size and fire service water application (interior only vs exterior-to-interior fire attack) on relative risk for skin burns in trapped occupants. A novel skin damage assessment tool utilizing ex vivo porcine skin samples was developed allowing measurement of temperatures at the surface of the porcine skin and at the subcutaneous fat surrogate interface. This tool allowed, for the first time, observation that typical fire attack methods resulted in short-lived transient increases in skin surface temperatures for a simulated occupant just outside the fire room that were typically around 5°C but ranged from 0°C to 15°C for rapid fire service intervention. Minimal differences were observed between the effects of interior or exterior fire streams immediately outside of the fire room. However, these values were markedly lower than when water application was delayed. This new tool provides novel information regarding trapped occupant skin burn risk that compliments traditional fire measurement tools and may provide a platform for future study on the impact of clothing as well as model based interpretation of experimental data that more accurately captures relevant physiology.

AB  - Occupational exposures to flame retardants (FRs), a class of suspected endocrine-disrupting compounds, are of health concern for firefighters. We sought to characterize exposure to FR compounds and evaluate their association with thyroid hormone levels, a biomarker of early effect, in female firefighters and office workers in San Francisco. In a cross-sectional study, we measured replacement organophosphate and organohalogen FRs in spot urine samples from firefighters (N = 86) and office workers (N = 84), as well as total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone in plasma for 84 firefighters and 81 office workers. Median bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (BDCPP) levels were 5 times higher in firefighters than office workers. Among firefighters, a doubling of BDCPP was associated with a 2.88% decrease (95% confidence interval −5.28, −0.42) in T4. We did not observe significant associations between FRs and T4 among office workers. In the full group, intermediate body mass index and a college education were associated with higher FR levels. The inverse association observed between FRs and T4 coupled with the lack of studies on women workers and evidence of adverse health effects from FR exposure─including endocrine disruption and breast cancer risk─warrant further research on occupational exposures and identification of opportunities for exposure reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of firefighter cancer risks were conducted prior to 1990 and do not reflect risk from advances in building materials. METHODS: A case-control study using California Cancer Registry data (1988-2007) was conducted to evaluate the risk of cancer among firefighters, stratified by race. RESULTS: This study identified 3,996 male firefighters with cancer. Firefighters were found to have a significantly elevated risk for melanoma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.1), multiple myeloma (OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0-1.8), acute myeloid leukemia (OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0-2.0), and cancers of the esophagus (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.2-2.1), prostate (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.3-1.7), brain (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-2.0), and kidney (OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.0-1.6). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to observing cancer findings consistent with previous research, this study generated novel findings for firefighters with race/ethnicity other than white. It provides additional evidence to support the association between firefighting and several specific cancers.

AB  - The stress system coordinates the adaptive responses of the organism to stressors of any kind.(1). The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC/NE)-autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the limbs of the autonomic system. Activation of the stress system leads to behavioral and peripheral changes that improve the ability of the organism to adjust homeostasis and increase its chances for survival. The CRH and LC/NE systems stimulate arousal and attention, as well as the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which is involved in anticipatory and reward phenomena, and the hypothalamic beta-endorphin system, which suppresses pain sensation and, hence, increases analgesia. CRH inhibits appetite and activates thermogenesis via the catecholaminergic system. Also, reciprocal interactions exist between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the stress system, which stimulates these elements and is regulated by them. CRH plays an important role in inhibiting GnRH secretion during stress, while, via somatostatin, it also inhibits GH, TRH and TSH secretion, suppressing, thus, the reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. Interestingly, all three of these functions receive and depend on positive catecholaminergic input. The end-hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, glucocorticoids, on the other hand, have multiple roles. They simultaneously inhibit the CRH, LC/NE and beta-endorphin systems and stimulate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the CRH peptidergic central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, they directly inhibit pituitary gonadotropin, GH and TSH secretion, render the target tissues of sex steroids and growth factors resistant to these substances and suppress the 5' deiodinase, which converts the relatively inactive tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) to triiodothyronine (T(3)), contributing further to the suppression of reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. They also have direct as well as insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension (metabolic syndrome X) and direct effects on the bone, causing "low turnover" osteoporosis. Central CRH, via glucocorticoids and catecholamines, inhibits the inflammatory reaction, while directly secreted by peripheral nerves CRH stimulates local inflammation (immune CRH). CRH antagonists may be useful in human pathologic states, such as melancholic depression and chronic anxiety, associated with chronic hyperactivity of the stress system, along with predictable behavioral, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune changes, based on the interrelations outlined above. Conversely, potentiators of CRH secretion/action may be useful to treat atypical depression, postpartum depression and the fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndromes, all characterized by low HPA axis and LC/NE activity, fatigue, depressive symptomatology, hyperalgesia and increased immune/inflammatory responses to stimuli.

AB  - The stress system coordinates the adaptive responses of the organism to stressors of any kind.(1). The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC/NE)-autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the limbs of the autonomic system. Activation of the stress system leads to behavioral and peripheral changes that improve the ability of the organism to adjust homeostasis and increase its chances for survival. The CRH and LC/NE systems stimulate arousal and attention, as well as the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which is involved in anticipatory and reward phenomena, and the hypothalamic beta-endorphin system, which suppresses pain sensation and, hence, increases analgesia. CRH inhibits appetite and activates thermogenesis via the catecholaminergic system. Also, reciprocal interactions exist between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the stress system, which stimulates these elements and is regulated by them. CRH plays an important role in inhibiting GnRH secretion during stress, while, via somatostatin, it also inhibits GH, TRH and TSH secretion, suppressing, thus, the reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. Interestingly, all three of these functions receive and depend on positive catecholaminergic input. The end-hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, glucocorticoids, on the other hand, have multiple roles. They simultaneously inhibit the CRH, LC/NE and beta-endorphin systems and stimulate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the CRH peptidergic central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, they directly inhibit pituitary gonadotropin, GH and TSH secretion, render the target tissues of sex steroids and growth factors resistant to these substances and suppress the 5' deiodinase, which converts the relatively inactive tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) to triiodothyronine (T(3)), contributing further to the suppression of reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. They also have direct as well as insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension (metabolic syndrome X) and direct effects on the bone, causing "low turnover" osteoporosis. Central CRH, via glucocorticoids and catecholamines, inhibits the inflammatory reaction, while directly secreted by peripheral nerves CRH stimulates local inflammation (immune CRH). CRH antagonists may be useful in human pathologic states, such as melancholic depression and chronic anxiety, associated with chronic hyperactivity of the stress system, along with predictable behavioral, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune changes, based on the interrelations outlined above. Conversely, potentiators of CRH secretion/action may be useful to treat atypical depression, postpartum depression and the fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndromes, all characterized by low HPA axis and LC/NE activity, fatigue, depressive symptomatology, hyperalgesia and increased immune/inflammatory responses to stimuli.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated whether physical fitness affects the perception of chronic stress in military trainees while controlling for established factors influencing stress perception. The sample consisted of 273 men (20.23 ± 1.12 years, 73.56 ± 10.52 kg, 1.78 ± 0.06 m). Physical fitness was measured by progressive endurance run (maximum oxygen uptake; VO2max), standing long jump, seated shot put, trunk muscle strength, and one leg standing test. Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Questionnaire in Weeks 1 and 11 of basic military training (BMT). VO2max and four influencing variables (perceived stress in Week 1, neuroticism, transformational leadership style, and education level) explained 44.44% of the variance of the increase in perceived stress during 10 weeks of BMT (R2 = 0.444, F = 23.334, p < .001). The explained variance of VO2 max was 4.14% (R2 = 0.041), with a Cohen's f2 effect size of 0.045 (assigned as a small effect by Cohen, ). The results indicate a moderating influence of good aerobic fitness on the varied level of perceived stress. We conclude that it is advisable to provide conscripts with a specific endurance training program prior to BMT for stress prevention reasons.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of two leather (L1, L2) and two rubber (R1, R2) boots on firefighters' metabolic and respiratory variables during simulated firefighting tasks. Twenty-five men and 25 women, while wearing full turnout clothing, a 10.5-kg backpack, gloves, helmet, and one of four randomly assigned pairs of firefighter boots, walked for 6 min at 3 mph (4.8 km/hr) on a level treadmill while carrying a 9.5-kg hose and climbed a stair ergometer for 6 min at 45 steps per min without the hose. Minute ventilation (VE), absolute and relative oxygen consumption (VO2 and VO2 ml kg min(-1), respectively), CO(2) production (VCO2), heart rate (HR), and peak inspiratory (PIF) and expiratory (PEF) flow rates were measured, and an average of the breath-by-breath data from minute 6 was used for analysis. During treadmill exercise, a 1-kg increase in boot weight caused significant (p < 0.05) increases in VE (9%), VO2 (5 - 6%), VCO2 (8%), and HR (6%) for men, whereas a 1-kg increase caused significant increases in VO2 (3 - 4.5%) and VCO2 (4%) for women. During stair ergometry, a 1-kg increase in boot weight caused significant increases in VE(approximately 3%), relative VO2 (approximately 2%), VCO2 (3%), and PIF (approximately 4%) in men and women (p < 0.05) and a significant increase in absolute VO2 (approximately 3.5%) in men only. Mean increases in metabolic and respiratory variables per 1-kg increase in boot weight were in the 5 to 12% range observed previously for men during treadmill walking but were considerably smaller for women. Mean increases in oxygen consumption during stair ergometry were statistically significant but were smaller in the current study than previously observed and may not be practically significant. There was no significant effect of boot design in addition to boot weight for either mode of exercise.

AB  - Labelling molecules with stable isotopes to create tracers has become a gold-standard method to study the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in humans. There are a range of techniques which use stable isotopes to measure fatty acid flux and oxidation, hepatic fatty synthesis, cholesterol absorption and synthesis and lipoprotein metabolism in humans. Stable isotope tracers are safe to use, enabling repeated studies to be undertaken and allowing studies to be undertaken in children and pregnant women. This review provides details of the most appropriate tracers to use, the techniques which have been developed and validated for measuring different aspects of lipid metabolism and some of the limitations of the methodology.

AB  - Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin released by many cells. These vesicles can mediate communication between cells, facilitating processes such as antigen presentation. Here, we show that exosomes from a mouse and a human mast cell line (MC/9 and HMC-1, respectively), as well as primary bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells, contain RNA. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of mRNA from approximately 1300 genes, many of which are not present in the cytoplasm of the donor cell. In vitro translation proved that the exosome mRNAs were functional. Quality control RNA analysis of total RNA derived from exosomes also revealed presence of small RNAs, including microRNAs. The RNA from mast cell exosomes is transferable to other mouse and human mast cells. After transfer of mouse exosomal RNA to human mast cells, new mouse proteins were found in the recipient cells, indicating that transferred exosomal mRNA can be translated after entering another cell. In summary, we show that exosomes contain both mRNA and microRNA, which can be delivered to another cell, and can be functional in this new location. We propose that this RNA is called "exosomal shuttle RNA" (esRNA).

AB  - Eccentric, or lengthening, contractions result in injury and subsequently stimulate the activation and proliferation of satellite stem cells which are important for skeletal muscle regeneration. The discovery of alternative myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscle raises the question as to whether stem cells other than satellite cells accumulate in muscle in response to exercise and contribute to post-exercise repair and/or growth. In this study, stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) positive, non-hematopoetic (CD45⁻) cells were evaluated in wild type (WT) and α7 integrin transgenic (α7Tg) mouse muscle, which is resistant to injury yet liable to strain, 24 hr following a single bout of eccentric exercise. Sca-1⁺CD45⁻ stem cells were increased 2-fold in WT muscle post-exercise. The α7 integrin regulated the presence of Sca-1⁺ cells, with expansion occurring in α7Tg muscle and minimal cells present in muscle lacking the α7 integrin. Sca-1⁺CD45⁻ cells isolated from α7Tg muscle following exercise were characterized as mesenchymal-like stem cells (mMSCs), predominantly pericytes. In vitro multiaxial strain upregulated mMSC stem cells markers in the presence of laminin, but not gelatin, identifying a potential mechanistic basis for the accumulation of these cells in muscle following exercise. Transplantation of DiI-labeled mMSCs into WT muscle increased Pax7⁺ cells and facilitated formation of eMHC⁺DiI⁻ fibers. This study provides the first demonstration that mMSCs rapidly appear in skeletal muscle in an α7 integrin dependent manner post-exercise, revealing an early event that may be necessary for effective repair and/or growth following exercise. The results from this study also support a role for the α7 integrin and/or mMSCs in molecular- and cellular-based therapeutic strategies that can effectively combat disuse muscle atrophy.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures comprising exosomes and microvesicles, which originate from the endosomal system or which are shed from the plasma membrane, respectively. They are present in biological fluids and are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. Extracellular vesicles are now considered as an additional mechanism for intercellular communication, allowing cells to exchange proteins, lipids and genetic material. Knowledge of the cellular processes that govern extracellular vesicle biology is essential to shed light on the physiological and pathological functions of these vesicles as well as on clinical applications involving their use and/or analysis. However, in this expanding field, much remains unknown regarding the origin, biogenesis, secretion, targeting and fate of these vesicles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stable isotope amino acids are regularly used as tracers to examine whole-body and muscle protein metabolism in humans. To accurately assess in vivo dietary protein digestion and absorption kinetics, the amino acid tracer is required to be incorporated within the dietary protein food source (i.e., intrinsically labeled protein). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the practicality of producing eggs and poultry meat intrinsically labeled with l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine through noninvasive oral tracer administration. METHODS: A specifically formulated diet containing 0.52% leucine was supplemented with 0.3% l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine and subsequently fed to 3 laying hens (Lohmann LSL Whites) for 55 d. On day 55, the hens were slaughtered and their meat, bones, and organs were harvested to determine tissue labeling. In Expt. 1, 2 healthy young men [mean +/- SEM age: 22 +/- 1.5 y; mean +/- SEM body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 23.7 +/- 0.5] ingested 18 g l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine-labeled egg protein. In Expt. 2, 2 healthy young men (mean +/- SEM age: 20.0 +/- 0.0 y; mean +/- SEM BMI: 26.4 +/- 3.1) ingested 28 g l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine-labeled poultry meat protein. Plasma samples (Expts. 1 and 2) and muscle biopsies (Expt. 1) were collected before and after labeled-food ingestion. RESULTS: High tracer labeling [>20 mole percent excess (MPE)] in the eggs was obtained after 7 d and maintained throughout the feeding protocol (P < 0.05). Over a 55-d period, approximately 850 g egg protein (145 eggs) was produced, with a mean +/- SEM tracer enrichment of 22.0 +/- 0.8 MPE. Mean +/- SEM l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine enrichment in the meat was 9.6 +/- 0.1 MPE. In Expts. 1 and 2, the consumption of labeled eggs and poultry meat protein increased plasma l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine enrichment, with mean +/- SEM peak values of 6.7 +/- 0.1 MPE and 4.0 +/- 0.9 MPE, respectively. The mean +/- SEM 5-h postprandial increase in myofibrillar l-[5,5,5-(2)H3]leucine enrichment after egg ingestion in healthy young men was 0.051 +/- 0.008 MPE (Expt. 1). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the feasibility of producing intrinsically labeled eggs and poultry meat for use in human metabolic research.

AB  - Clinical and consumer market interest is increasingly directed toward the use of plant-based proteins as dietary components aimed at preserving or increasing skeletal muscle mass. However, recent evidence suggests that the ingestion of the plant-based proteins in soy and wheat results in a lower muscle protein synthetic response when compared with several animal-based proteins. The possible lower anabolic properties of plant-based protein sources may be attributed to the lower digestibility of plant-based sources, in addition to greater splanchnic extraction and subsequent urea synthesis of plant protein-derived amino acids compared with animal-based proteins. The latter may be related to the relative lack of specific essential amino acids in plant- as opposed to animal-based proteins. Furthermore, most plant proteins have a relatively low leucine content, which may further reduce their anabolic properties when compared with animal proteins. However, few studies have actually assessed the postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of plant proteins, with soy and wheat protein being the primary sources studied. Despite the proposed lower anabolic properties of plant vs. animal proteins, various strategies may be applied to augment the anabolic properties of plant proteins. These may include the following: 1) fortification of plant-based protein sources with the amino acids methionine, lysine, and/or leucine; 2) selective breeding of plant sources to improve amino acid profiles; 3) consumption of greater amounts of plant-based protein sources; or 4) ingesting multiple protein sources to provide a more balanced amino acid profile. However, the efficacy of such dietary strategies on postprandial muscle protein synthesis remains to be studied. Future research comparing the anabolic properties of a variety of plant-based proteins should define the preferred protein sources to be used in nutritional interventions to support skeletal muscle mass gain or maintenance in both healthy and clinical populations.

AB  - In order to determine differences in absorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) between anatomical sites and individuals, coal-tar ointment was applied to skin of volunteers at various sites. The surface disappearance of PAH and the excretion of urinary 1-OH-pyrene after skin application of coal-tar ointment were used as parameters for dermal PAH absorption. The surface disappearance was determined by the measurement of the fluorescence of PAH on skin. Surface disappearance measurements show low but significant differences in dermal PAH absorption between anatomical sites: shoulder > forehead, forearm, groin, > ankle, hand (palmar site). The average PAH absorption rate constant at different skin sites ranges from 0.036/h to 0.135/h (overall mean: 0.066/h). This indicates that after 6 h of exposure, 20-56% of a low dermal dose of PAH (e.g., about 1.0 ng pyrene/cm2) will be absorbed. The interindividual differences in PAH absorption are small (7%) in comparison with differences between anatomical sites (69%). Results based on the urinary excretion of 1-OH-pyrene are less clear. The site of application of the coal-tar ointment (dose: 2.5 mg/cm2 during 6 h) has no significant effect on the excreted amount of 1-OH-pyrene in urine. It is estimated that after coal-tar ointment application on skin, 0.3-1.4% of the pyrene dose (about 2 micrograms pyrene/cm2) becomes systemically available. For the accurate estimation of PAH uptake through skin of workers, it seems relevant to distinguish different body regions, not only because of the regional variation in percutaneous PAH absorption, but also because of the high dispersal of PAH contamination on skin of workers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: C2C12 myoblasts undergo in vitro myogenesis to form protein-rich multinucleated myotubes. Determining the fraction of total nuclei incorporated into myotubes is a commonly used method to quantify the extent of differentiation, but it is labor-intensive and susceptible to operator bias. METHODS: We have developed a simple method to quantify myotube formation using micrographs of Jenner-Giemsa-stained C2C12 cultures. Because myotubes are darkly stained by Jenner-Giemsa dyes, the extent of myotube formation correlates with an increase in pixels attributed to the darkest tones. Thus, image histograms were obtained from photographs using ImageJ software, and the sum of the darkest tones was used as a measure of myotube density. RESULTS: Measurements of myotube density mirrored those of fusion index during C2C12 differentiation and after treatment with prostaglandin D(2) , an inhibitor of C2C12 myogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We propose this inexpensive, quick, and unbiased method to quantify C2C12 differentiation as a complement of the fusion index analysis.

AB  - Myogenesis is the formation of muscle tissue from muscle precursor cells. Physical exercise induces satellite cell activation in muscle. Currently, C2C12 murine myoblast cells are used to study myogenic differentiation. Herein, we evaluated whether human LHCN-M2 myoblasts can differentiate into mature myotubes and express early (myotube formation, creatine kinase activity and myogenin) and late (MyHC-β) muscle-specific markers when cultured in differentiation medium (DM) for 2, 4 and 7 days. We demonstrate that treatment of LHCN-M2 cells with DM supplemented with 0.5% serum from long-term (3 years) differently exercised subjects for 4 days induced myotube formation and significantly increased the early (creatine kinase activity and myogenin) and late (MyHC-β expression) differentiation markers versus cells treated with serum from untrained subjects. Interestingly, serum from aerobic exercised subjects (swimming) had a greater positive effect on late-differentiation marker (MyHC-β) expression than serum from anaerobic (body building) or from mixed exercised (soccer and volleyball) subjects. Moreover, p62and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression was lower in LHCN-M2 cells cultured with human sera from differently exercised subjectst han in cells cultured with DM. In conclusion, LHCN-M2 human myoblasts represent a species-specific system with which to study human myogenic differentiation induced by serum from differently exercised subjects.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic chemical used in the production of plastics since the 1950s and a known endocrine disruptor, is a ubiquitous component of the material environment and human body. New research on very-low-dose exposure to BPA suggests an association with adverse health effects, including breast and prostate cancer, obesity, neurobehavioral problems, and reproductive abnormalities. These findings challenge the long-standing scientific and legal presumption of BPA's safety. The history of how BPA's safety was defined and defended provides critical insight into the questions now facing lawmakers and regulators: is BPA safe, and if not, what steps must be taken to protect the public's health? Answers to both questions involve reforms in chemical policy, with implications beyond BPA.

AB  - While hearing protection devices (HPD) have been the last and often only line of defense against noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace, their performance has been suspect. Laboratory evaluations have not proven to predict the actual performance of HPD in the field. Individual fit testing of HPD will allow the determination of HPD performance on individual workers, and this will improve the ability to select HPD appropriate for given noise exposures and intervene with workers to ensure sufficiency in HPD performance. A modified microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) has been adapted to test a variety of HPD quickly and reliably in situ. A dual-element microphone and software combination permits reliable noise reduction measurements. Statistically developed compensation factors permit direct comparison of F-MIRE predicted personal attenuation ratings to traditional laboratory measures of HPD performance using real-ear-attenuation-at-threshold assessments.

AB  - There is incomplete information about how physically demanding rescue work may be. The aim therefore of this paper was to examine the physiological responses of firefighters during a simulated rescue of hospital patients and to relate the firefighters' performance to their endurance, strength and working technique. Fourteen part-time male firefighters with a maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) of 4.4 +/- 0.3 l/min (mean +/- SD) served as subjects in this study. First, each firefighter ascended six floors (a 20.5 m vertical ascent) carrying tools, wearing protective clothing and a breathing apparatus, an extra mass of 37 kg. He thereafter 'rescued' six persons by dragging each person on a fire-sheet on a flat floor. The technique used was recorded and the O(2) uptake and the heart rate were measured continuously during the whole operation. The blood lactate concentration and the subjective rating of perceived exertion were measured during and just after the rescue. The VO(2max) and the muscle strength were measured in the laboratory. The whole operation was carried out in the course of 5-9 min. The operation was a virtual all-out effort and the peak blood lactate concentration was 13 +/- 3 mmol/l. The peak oxygen uptake was 3.7 +/- 0.5 l/min (84% of the VO(2max)) during the operation. Large and heavy firefighters carried out the task faster than smaller ones. The VO(2max) in absolute terms and the dragging technique used were both related to the rescue performance. Rescuing patients at a hospital was physically very demanding and the time needed to complete the task depended on the VO(2max) in absolute values and the working technique used. A minimum VO(2max) of 4 l/min for firefighters was recommended.

AB  - Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 31.4% of deaths globally in 2012. It is estimated that, from 1980 to 2000, reduction in total cholesterol accounted for a 33% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in the United States. In other developed countries, similar decreases in CHD deaths (ranging from 19%-46%) have been attributed to reduction in total cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has now largely replaced total cholesterol as a risk marker and the primary treatment target for hyperlipidemia. Reduction in LDL-C levels by statin-based therapies has been demonstrated to result in a reduction in the risk of nonfatal CV events and mortality in a continuous and graded manner over a wide range of baseline risk and LDL-C levels. This article provides a review of (1) the relationship between LDL-C and CV risk from a biologic, epidemiologic, and genetic standpoint; (2) evidence-based strategies for LDL-C lowering; (3) lipid-management guidelines; (4) new strategies to further reduce CV risk through LDL-C lowering; and (5) population-level and health-system initiatives aimed at identifying, treating, and lowering lifetime LDL-C exposure.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of a linear position transducer (LPT) for the squat jump (SJ) and counter-movement jump (CMJ) height. Twenty-eight subjects (25.18 ± 7.1 years) performed three SJs followed by three CMJs using a force plate concurrently with the LPT to test validity. Subjects returned on a separate day, at least 48 h apart, to measure test-retest reliability. A t-test showed a significant difference between the two devices for both SJ (p < 0.001) and CMJ (p < 0.001) while Bland⁻Altman analysis for validity revealed that the LPT overestimated jump height for both SJ (mean difference (MD) = 8.01 ± 2.93 cm) and CMJ (MD = 8.68 ± 2.99 cm). With regards to reliability of the LPT, mean intraclass correlation (ICC) for both SJ (ICC = 0.84) and CMJ (ICC = 0.95) were high, and Bland⁻Altman analysis showed mean differences lower than minimal detectable change (MDC) between the days for both SJ (MD = 1.89 ± 4.16 cm vs. MDC = 2.72 cm) and CMJ (MD = 0.47 ± 3.23 cm vs. MDC = 2.11 cm). Additionally, there was a low coefficient of variation (CV) between days for both SJ (CV = 3.25%) and CMJ (CV = 0.74%). Therefore, while the LPT overestimates jump height, it is a reliable tool for tracking changes in jump height to measure performance improvement and monitor fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Firefighters regularly re-enter fire scenes during long duration emergency events with limited rest between work bouts. It is unclear whether this practice is impacting on the safety of firefighters. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of multiple work bouts on firefighter physiology, strength, and cognitive performance when working in the heat. METHODS: Seventy-seven urban firefighters completed two 20-minute simulated search and rescue tasks in a heat chamber (105 +/- 5 degrees C), separated by a 10-minute passive recovery. Core and skin temperature, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensation (TS), grip strength, and cognitive changes between simulations were evaluated. RESULTS: Significant increases in core temperature and perceptual responses along with declines in strength were observed following the second simulation. No differences for other measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in thermal strain was observed when firefighters re-entered a hot working environment. We recommend that longer recovery periods or active cooling methods be employed prior to re-entry.

AB  - Firefighters are exposed to hot environments, which results in elevated core temperatures. Rapidly reducing core temperatures will likely increase safety as firefighters are redeployed to subsequent operational tasks. This study investigated the effectiveness of cold-water immersion (CWI) and iced-slush ingestion (SLUSH) to cool firefighters post-incident. Seventy-four Australian firefighters (mean +/- SD age: 38.9 +/- 9.0 years) undertook a simulated search and rescue task in a heat chamber (105 +/- 5 degrees C). Testing involved two 20-min work cycles separated by a 10-min rest period. Ambient temperature during recovery periods was 19.3 +/- 2.7 degrees C. Participants were randomly assigned one of three 15-min cooling protocols: (i) CWI, 15 degrees C to umbilicus; (ii) SLUSH, 7 g.kg(-1) body weight; or (iii) seated rest (CONT). Core temperature and strength were measured pre- and postsimulation and directly after cooling. Mean temperatures for all groups reached 38.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C at the conclusion of the second work task. Both CWI and SLUSH delivered cooling rates in excess of CONT (0.093 and 0.092 compared with 0.058 degrees C.min(-1)) and reduced temperatures to baseline measurements within the 15-min cooling period. Grip strength was not negatively impacted by either SLUSH or CONT. CWI and SLUSH provide evidence-based alternatives to passive recovery and forearm immersion protocols currently adopted by many fire services. To maximise the likelihood of adoption, we recommend SLUSH ingestion as a practical and effective cooling strategy for post-incident cooling of firefighters in temperate regions.

AB  - When firefighters work in hot conditions, altered immune and inflammatory responses may increase the risk of a cardiac event. The present study aimed to establish the time course of such responses. Forty-two urban firefighters completed a repeat work protocol in a heat chamber (100 ± 5°C). Changes to leukocytes, platelets, TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, LPS and CRP were evaluated immediately post-work and also after 1 and 24 h of rest. Increases in core temperatures were associated with significant increases in leukocytes, platelets and TNFα directly following work. Further, platelets continued to increase at 1 h (+31.2 ± 31.3 ? 109 l, p < 0.01) and remained elevated at 24 h (+15.9 ± 19.6 ? 109 l, p < 0.01). Sustained increases in leukocytes and platelets may increase the risk of cardiac events in firefighters when performing repeat work tasks in the heat. This is particularly relevant during multi-day deployments following natural disasters.Practitioner Summary: Firefighters regularly re-enter fire affected buildings or are redeployed to further operational tasks. Should work in the heat lead to sustained immune and inflammatory changes following extended rest periods, incident controllers should plan appropriate work/rest cycles to minimise these changes and any subsequent risks of cardiac events.

AB  - The high level of meat and saturated fat consumption in the USA and other high-income countries exceeds nutritional needs and contributes to high rates of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and some cancers. Affluent citizens in middle- and low-income countries are adopting similar high-meat diets and experiencing increased rates of these same chronic diseases. The industrial agricultural system, now the predominant form of agriculture in the USA and increasingly world-wide, has consequences for public health owing to its extensive use of fertilisers and pesticides, unsustainable use of resources and environmental pollution. In industrial animal production there are public health concerns surrounding feed formulations that include animal tissues, arsenic and antibiotics as well as occupational health risks and risks for nearby communities. It is of paramount importance for public health professionals to become aware of and involved in how our food is produced. © The Authors 2005.

AB  - Military personnel engage in strenuous physical activity and load carriage. This study evaluated the role of body mass and of added mass on aerobic performance (uphill treadmill exercise) and pulmonary function. Performance on a traditional unloaded run test (4.8 km) was compared with performance on loaded tasks. Subjects performed an outdoor 4.8-km run and four maximal treadmill tests wearing loads of 0, 10, 20 and 30 kg. Subjects' pulmonary function (forced expired volume in 1 second, FEV1; forced vital capacity, FVC; maximal voluntary ventilation, MVV) was tested with each load and peak values of heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were measured during each treadmill test. Performance on the 4.8-km run was correlated with treadmill performance, measured as time to exhaustion (TTE), with the strength of the correlation decreasing with load (r = 0.87 for 0 kg to 0.76 for 30 kg). Body mass was not correlated with TTE, other than among men with the 30-kg load (r = 0.48). During treadmill exercise, all peak responses other than RER decreased with load. Pulmonary function measures (FEV1, FVC and MVV) decreased with load. Body mass was poorly correlated with treadmill performance, but added mass decreased performance. The decreased performance may be due in part to decreased pulmonary function. Unloaded 4.8-km run performance was correlated to unloaded uphill treadmill performance, but less so as load increased. Therefore, traditional run tests may not be an effective means of evaluating aerobic performance for military field operations.

AB  - Protein ingestion before sleep augments postexercise muscle protein synthesis during overnight recovery. It is unknown whether postexercise and presleep protein consumption modulates postprandial protein handling and myofibrillar protein synthetic responses the following morning. Sixteen healthy young (24 +/- 1 yr) men performed unilateral resistance-type exercise (contralateral leg acting as a resting control) at 2000. Participants ingested 20 g of protein immediately after exercise plus 60 g of protein presleep (PRO group; n = 8) or equivalent boluses of carbohydrate (CON; n = 8). The subsequent morning participants received primed, continuous infusions of l-[ring-(2)H5]phenylalanine and l-[1-(13)C]leucine combined with ingestion of 20 g intrinsically l-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine- and l-[1-(13)C]leucine-labeled protein to assess postprandial protein handling and myofibrillar protein synthesis in the rested and exercised leg in CON and PRO. Exercise increased postabsorptive myofibrillar protein synthesis rates the subsequent day (P < 0.001), with no differences between CON and PRO. Protein ingested in the morning increased myofibrillar protein synthesis in both the exercised and rested leg (P < 0.01), with no differences between treatments. Myofibrillar protein bound l-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine enrichments were greater in the exercised (0.016 +/- 0.002 and 0.015 +/- 0.002 MPE in CON and PRO, respectively) vs. rested (0.010 +/- 0.002 and 0.009 +/- 0.002 MPE in CON and PRO, respectively) leg (P < 0.05), with no differences between treatments (P > 0.05). The additive effects of resistance-type exercise and protein ingestion on myofibrillar protein synthesis persist for more than 12 h after exercise and are not modulated by protein consumption during acute postexercise recovery. This work provides evidence of an extended window of opportunity where presleep protein supplementation can be an effective nutrient timing strategy to optimize skeletal muscle reconditioning.

AB  - Contaminants deposited on the firefighter protective clothing increase the risk of carcinogenesis by transdermal absorption. The effects of the inclination angle, waterproof grade, and fabric structure of the flame retardant outer layer of firefighting protective clothing on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination and laundering were studied by simulating smoking exposure. The permeation and transmission process of PAHs in multilayered assemblies were investigated. Results showed that the adsorption capacity of soot and PAH contamination on fabric with a water repellent finish relatively increased, and outer layer absorbed more PAHs at 180° compared to other inclination angles. The fabric structure with single layer had a strong adsorption capacity and low removal capacity for PAHs. The highest amount of PAH contaminant was found in the moisture barrier layer, and the removal rate (44.7%) was much lower than that of the outer layer cleaned through conventional laundering (91.3%). The research can better provide scientific support for pollution control and clothing cleaning in the actual firefight.

AB  - In the European Society of Cardiology-European Society of Hypertension guidelines of the year 2007, the consequences of arterial stiffness and wave reflection on cardiovascular mortality have a major role. But the investigators claimed the poor availability of devices/methods providing easy and widely suitable measuring of arterial wall stiffness or their surrogates like augmentation index (AIx) or aortic systolic blood pressure (aSBP). The aim of this study was the validation of a novel method determining AIx and aSBP based on an oscillometric method using a common cuff (ARCSolver) against a validated tonometric system (SphygmoCor). aSBP and AIx measured with the SphygmoCor and ARCSolver method were compared for 302 subjects. The mean age was 56 years with an s.d. of 20 years. At least two iterations were performed in each session. This resulted in 749 measurements. For aSBP the mean difference was -0.1 mm Hg with an s.d. of 3.1 mm Hg. The mean difference for AIx was 1.2% with an s.d. of 7.9%. There was no significant difference in reproducibility of AIx for both methods. The variation estimate of inter- and intraobserver measurements was 6.3% for ARCSolver and 7.5% for SphygmoCor. The ARCSolver method is a novel method determining AIx and aSBP based on an oscillometric system with a cuff. The results agree with common accepted tonometric measurements. Its application is easy and for widespread use.

AB  - Physiological energy expenditure measurement has proven to be a reliable method of quantitatively assessing the penalties imposed by gait disability. The purpose of this review is to outline the basic principles of exercise physiology relevant to human locomotion; detail the energy expenditure of normal walking; and summarize the results of energy expenditure studies performed in patients with specific neurologic and orthopedic disabilities. The magnitude of the disabilities and the patients’ capacity to tolerate the increased energy requirements are compared. This paper also will examine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions at mitigating the energetic penalties of disability during ambulation.

AB  - Watkins, CM, Barillas, SR, Wong, MA, Archer, DC, Dobbs, IJ, Lockie, RG, Coburn, JW, Tran, TT, and Brown, LE. Determination of vertical jump as a measure of neuromuscular readiness and fatigue. J Strength Cond Res 31(12): 3305-3310, 2017-Coaches closely monitor training loads and periodize sessions throughout the season to create optimal adaptations at the proper time. However, only monitoring training loads ignores the innate physiological stress each athlete feels individually. Vertical jump (VJ) is widely used as a measure of lower-body power, and has been used in postmatch studies to demonstrate fatigue levels. However, no pretraining monitoring by VJ performance has been previously studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of VJ as a measure of readiness and fatigue on a daily sessional basis. Ten healthy resistance-trained males (mass = 91.60 ± 13.24 kg; height = 179.70 ± 9.23 cm; age = 25.40 ± 1.51 years) and 7 females (mass = 65.36 ± 12.29 kg; height = 162.36 ± 5.75 cm; age = 25.00 ± 2.71 years) volunteered to participate. Vertical jump and BRUNEL Mood Assessment (BAM) were measured 4 times: pre-workout 1, post-workout 1, pre-workout 2, and post-workout 2. Workout intensity was identical for both workouts, consisting of 4 sets of 5 repetitions for hang cleans, and 4 sets of 6 repetitions for push presses at 85% 1 repetition maximum (1RM), followed by 4 sets to failure of back squats (BSs), Romanian deadlift, and leg press at 80% 1RM. The major finding was that VJ height decrement (-8.05 ± 9.65 cm) at pre-workout 2 was correlated (r = 0.648) with BS volume decrement (-27.56 ± 24.56%) between workouts. This is important for coaches to proactively understand the current fatigue levels of their athletes and their readiness to resistance training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases and is typically identified by measuring blood pressure (BP) at the brachial artery. Although such a measurement may accurately determine diastolic BP, systolic BP is not reflected accurately. Current noninvasive techniques for assessing central aortic BP require additional recording of an arterial pressure wave using a high-fidelity applanation tonometer. Within one measurement cycle, the Mobil-O-Graph BP device uses brachial oscillometric BP waves for a noninvasive estimation of central BP. We therefore validated the Mobil-O-Graph against the SphygmoCor device, which is widely known as the commonly used approach for a noninvasive estimation of central BP. METHODS: For each individual, we compared three readings of the central BP values obtained by the Mobil-O-Graph and SphygmoCor device consecutively. One hundred individuals (mean age 56.1 ± 15.4 years) were recruited for measurement.Differences between the central BP values of the test device and the SphygmoCor device were calculated for each measurement. RESULTS: The mean difference (95% confidence interval) for the estimated central systolic BP between both devices was -0.6 ± 3.7 mmHg. Comparison of the central BP values measured by the two devices showed a statistically significant linear correlation (R=0.91, P<0.0001). The mean between-method difference was 0.50 mmHg for central systolic BP estimation. The intrarater reproducibility between both the devices was also comparable. Bland and Altman analyses showed that the mean differences (95% confidence interval) between repeated measurements were 1.89 (0.42-3.36) mmHg and 1.36 (-0.16 to 2.83) mmHg for the SphygmoCor and the Mobil-O-Graph device, respectively. Thus, neither of these differences was statistically significantly different from 0. The limits of agreement were -16.34 to 19.73 and -15.23 to 17.17 mmHg for the SphygmoCor and the Mobil-O-Graph device, respectively. CONCLUSION: Oscillometric noninvasive estimation of central BP with the Mobil-O-Graph BP device is as effective as using the well-established SphygmoCor applanation tonometry device. In comparison, the Mobil-O-Graph combines the widespread benefits of brachial BP measurement and also provides central BP within one measurement.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an extremely persistent perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), and 2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX), its shorter chain alternative, have been implicated in hepatocellular damage with unusual fat deposit and liver enlargement. In this study we explored the underlying mechanisms of PFOA and GenX induced hepatocellular damage. Liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was used as a model to study induced liver inflammation in vitro at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels. HepG2 cells were exposed to PFOA or GenX for 48 h and the DNA and RNA were extracted and analyzed. mRNA expression analysis of PFOA exposed cells showed that cell cycle homeostasis genes were affected significantly, as well as the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) and the essential lipid metabolism genes. GenX did not have as significant an effect. Global methylation levels of HepG2 cells were found to be inversely proportional to PFOA exposure levels. With GenX, the global methylation level decreased and then increased. Our work points to the fact that PFOA may contribute to higher overall epigenetic toxicity than GenX, and its induced epigenetic changes may play a major role in lipid metabolism gene regulation and fat deposits.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a ubiquitous industrial pollutant, is a known endocrine disrupter implicated in metabolic diseases. Prenatal DEHP exposure promotes epigenetic multi- and transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease in subsequent generations (F1-F3). However, the epigenetic toxicity is less understood in the liver. In this study, CD-1 mice were prenatally exposed to 20 μg/kg/day, 200 μg/kg/day, 500 mg/kg/day, or 750 mg/kg/day DEHP from gestational day (GD) 10.5 until birth of pups. Following prenatal exposure, the multigenerational and transgenerational effects of mRNA expression of epigenetic regulators were evaluated in F1, F2, and F3 generation mouse livers at postnatal days (PNDs) 8 and 60. Results showed that DEHP exposed mice livers exhibited significant changes in global DNA methylation levels in all three generations, with the effect being different in F2 after high dosage exposure. Histopathology indicated that DEHP exposure could induce mild damage in F1 livers. The expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were significantly changed in both the F1 and F2 generations at PND 8, suggesting that maintenance Dnmt1 plays a major role in the multigenerational effect that occur in the early developmental stages. Additionally, DEHP exposure caused significant changes in ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine (Tet) dioxygenases encoding Tet1 expression in all three generations and Tet2 expression in F3 at PND 60, implicating their contributions in inducing both multi- and transgenerational effects after DEHP exposure in mouse liver. Overall, our results establish that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure are critical for epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation in female mouse livers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is emerging awareness that movement disorders rank among the most common neurological diseases. However, the overall burden of these disorders in the general community is not well defined. We sought to assess the prevalence of all common categories of movement disorders in a population, accounting for sex differences and age trends. METHODS: As part of an ongoing prospective population-based study of carotid atherosclerosis and stroke risk (the Bruneck Study), a total of 706 men and women aged 50-89 years underwent a thorough neurological assessment. The diagnosis of movement disorders and ratings for disease severity were based on standard criteria and scales. Prevalences were estimated from logistic regression models (regression-smoothed rates) and standardised to the age and sex structure of the general community. FINDINGS: The prevalence of all common categories of movement disorders was 28.0% (95% CI 25.9-30.1). Proportions in men (27.6% [95% CI 24.5-30.7]) and women (28.3% [25.5-31.2]) were closely similar and sharply increased with age (from 18.5% [15.0-22.0] in 50-59-year olds to 51.3% [44.9-57.7] in 80-89-year olds). Almost half of all patients (90/214) had moderate-to-severe disease expression, but only 7.0% (15/214) received standard drug treatment. Prevalence of tremor was 14.5%, followed by restless legs syndrome (10.8%), parkinsonism (7%), primary dystonia and secondary dystonia (1.8%), and chorea and tics (<1% each). A fifth of all movement disorders were diagnosed to be probably drug-induced. INTERPRETATION: There is a high prevalence of and substantial under-recognition and under-treatment of movement disorders in the general community.

AB  - Assessment of hand strength is used in a wide range of clinical settings especially during treatment of diseases affecting the function of the hand. This investigation aimed to determine age- and gender-specific reference values for grip and pinch strength in a normal Swiss population with special regard to old and very old subjects as well as to different levels of occupational demand. Hand strength data were collected using a Jamar dynamometer and a pinch gauge with standard testing position, protocol and instructions. Analysis of the data from 1023 tested subjects between 18 and 96 years revealed a curvilinear relationship of grip and pinch strength to age, a correlation to height, weight and significant differences between occupational groups. Hand strength values differed significantly from those of other populations, confirming the thesis that applying normative data internationally is questionable. Age- and gender-specific reference values for grip and pinch strength are presented.

AB  - AbstractFire suppression wearing thermal protective clothing (TPC) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) challenges a firefighter?s balance and may explain firefighter falls. Postural control based on force plate centre of pressure (COP) was compared for healthy subjects wearing TPC and SCBA before and after 20 min of heavy physical exertion in hot conditions. Baseline measures with and without TPC and SCBA (two different SCBA cylinder masses) were compared before and after exertion that included elements of fire suppression activities in an environmental chamber. COP excursion and variability increased with exertion for TPC and SCBA conditions compared to non-stressed conditions. The two different cylinder masses had no significant effect. Wearing TPC and SCBA when physically stressed in a hot environment increases postural sway and exacerbates postural control. Subjects compensated for the extra mass and adjusted to control postural sway with the addition of TPC and SCBA, but the stress protocol amplified these adjustments.Practitioner Summary: Firefighters wear thermal protective clothing (TPC) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) when heat-stressed and fatigued. Wearing TPC and SCBA was found to negatively impact balance when stressed, but not for non-stressed or two different sized SCBA tanks. Simulating fire-ground conditions wearing TPC and SCBA should be considered for improving balance.

AB  - Cushing's syndrome is a consequence of primary or, more commonly, secondary oversecretion of cortisol. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Cushing's syndrome, and excess risk remains even in effectively treated patients. The cardiovascular consequences of cortisol excess are protean and include, inter alia, elevation of blood pressure, truncal obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This review analyses the relationship of cortisol excess, both locally and at tissue level, to these cardiovascular risk factors, and to putative mechanisms for hypertension. Previous studies have examined correlations between cortisol, blood pressure, and other parameters in the general population and in Cushing's syndrome. This review also details changes induced by short-term cortisol administration in normotensive healthy men.

AB  - Detailed characterization of a firefighter’s typical thermal exposures during live-fire training and responses can provide important insights into the risks faced and the necessary protections, protocols, and standards required. In order to gather data on representative thermal conditions from a firefighter’s continually varying local environment in a live-fire training exercise, a portable heat flux and gas temperature measurement system was created, calibrated, and integrated into firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE). Data were collected from 25 live-fire training exposures during seven different types of scenarios. Based on the collected data, mild training environments generally exposed firefighters to temperatures around 50°C and heat fluxes around 1 kW/m2, while severe training conditions generally resulted in temperatures between 150°C and 200°C with heat fluxes between 3 kW/m2 and 6 kW/m2. For every scenario investigated, the heat flux data portrayed a more severe environment than the temperature data when interpreted using established thermal classes developed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology for electronic equipment used by first responders. Local temperatures from the portable measurement system were compared with temperatures measured by stationary thermocouples installed in the training structure for 14 different exposures. It was determined the stationary temperatures represented only a rough approximate bound of the actual temperature of the immediate training environment due to the typically coarse distribution of these sensors throughout the structure and their relative (fixed) distance from the fire sets. The portable thermal measurement system has provided new insights into the integration of electronic sensors with firefighter PPE and the conditions experienced by firefighters in live-fire training scenarios, which has promise to improve the safety and health of the fire service.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature evaluating the reliability and validity of all available methods for measuring active and passive cervical range of motion (CROM). METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and AMED) were searched through OVID from their inception to January 2008. Articles were selected according to a priori defined criteria. Data were extracted regarding publication details, type of study, movements and device evaluated, subject and observer characteristics, and measurement protocol including blinding and statistical analysis methods. Quality assessment was undertaken using developed criteria to assess internal validity, external validity, and statistical methods. An estimate of the level of reliability and validity was calculated and used to categorize studies as good, moderate, or poor. RESULTS: A total of 56 articles fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the review. Forty-six of these articles described 66 reliability studies and 21 described 21 concurrent criterion validity studies. Twelve different methods were evaluated. Although it was the intention of this review to conduct meta-analysis, this was deemed inappropriate due to studies being too heterogeneous. Most of the reliability and validity studies involved asymptomatic subjects measured by allied health professionals investigating active ROM. Devices that were deemed to have "good" reliability and validity were the CROM device, the Spin-T goniometer, and the single inclinometer. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of reliability and concurrent validity studies have been published for CROM. The CROM device has undergone most evaluation and has been shown to be clinimetrically sound. Further research with significantly improved methodology and reporting is warranted for all devices.

AB  - This study investigated the physiological responses to wearing a standard firefighter ensemble (SE) and a prototype ensemble (PE) modified from the SE that contained additional features, such as magnetic ring enclosures at the glove-sleeve interface, integrated boot-pant interface, integrated hood-SCBA facepiece interface, and a novel hose arrangement that rerouted self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) exhaust gases back into the upper portion of the jacket. Although the features of the PE increased the level of encapsulation of the wearer that could lead to increased physiological stress compared with the SE, it was hypothesized that the rerouted exhaust gases provided by the PE hose assembly would (1) provide convective cooling to the upper torso, (2) reduce the thermal stress experienced by the wearer, and (3) reduce the overall physiological stress imposed by the PE such that it would be either less or not significantly different from the SE. Ten subjects (seven male, three female) performed treadmill exercise in an environmental chamber (22 degrees C, 50% RH) at 50% [image omitted]O(2max) while wearing either the SE with an SCBA or the PE with an SCBA either with or without the hose attached (designated PEWH and PENH, respectively). Heart rate (HR), rectal and intestinal temperatures (T(re), T(in)), sweat loss, and endurance time were measured. All subjects completed at least 20 min of treadmill exercise during the testing. At the end of exercise, there was no difference in T(re) (p = 0.45) or T(in) (p = 0.42), HR, or total sweat loss between the SE and either PEWH or PENH (p = 0.59). However, T(sk) was greater in PEWH and PENH compared with SE (p < 0.05). Total endurance time in SE was greater than in either PEWH or PENH (p < 0.05). Thus, it was concluded that the rerouting of exhaust gases to the jacket did not provide significant convective cooling or reduce thermal stress compared with the SE under the mild conditions selected, and the data did not support the hypotheses of the present study.

AB  - Air consumption, oxygen uptake (VO(2)), carbon dioxide output (VCO(2)) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER=VCO(2)/VO(2)) were measured directly from the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) as 36 professional firefighters (three women) completed scenarios of high-rise stair climbing and fifth floor search and rescue. During stair climbing VO(2) was 75+/-8% VO(2max) (mean+/-SD), RER=1.10+/-0.10, and heart rate=91+/-3% maximum (based on maximum treadmill data). Firefighters stopped climbing on consuming 55% of the air cylinder then descended. In the fifth floor search and rescue VO(2) was slightly lower than stair climbing but RER remained elevated (1.13+/-0.12) reflecting high anaerobic metabolism. The first low air alarm sounded, indicating 25% of the air remaining in a "30-min cylinder", during the stair climb at 8 min with 19 of 36 sounding before 12 min. Aggressive air management strategies are required for safety in high-rise firefighting.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT) is used by fire departments across North America to screen for minimal physical capabilities in potential candidates, but its physiological demands are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output (V x O2, V x CO2) and heart rate (HR) responses with the portable system in 57 subjects (23 females) who were familiarized before completing the CPAT in times similar to those of actual candidates. Two men and nine women failed to complete the circuit because of fatigue. Thirty-two men (91%) and four women (15%) completed the circuit under the criterion time (10 min 20 s) with mean completion times for men (8 min 32 s +/- 51 s) and women (11 min 16 s +/- 1 min 28 s, P < 0.05). For all finishers, V x O2 during the test was 38.5 and 36.6 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1), corresponding to 73% and 71% of V x O 2max for men and women, and HR was 90% and 91% of maximum (P > 0.05). RER averaged 1.02 for men and 0.97 for women suggesting elevated anaerobic metabolism. Women had a drop in RER after the second event, and they were significantly slower at each event after the step mill than the men. Prediction of circuit completion time by backward stepwise regression yielded models with absolute V x O 2max alone or relative V x O 2max plus body mass and handgrip strength accounting for more than 67% of the variance but with large errors of estimation exceeding 75 s. CONCLUSION: The CPAT challenged both the aerobic and anaerobic energy supply systems, and the average V x O2 and HR were similar to reported values during firefighting simulations with incumbent firefighters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is controversial whether the onset of myocardial infarction occurs randomly or is precipitated by identifiable stimuli. Previous studies have suggested a higher risk of cardiac events in association with exertion. METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were identified by recording all admissions to our hospital in Berlin and by monitoring a general population of 330,000 residents in Augsburg, Germany. Information on the circumstances of each infarction was obtained by means of standardized interviews. The data analysis included a comparison of patients with matched controls and a case-crossover comparison (one in which each patient serves as his or her own control) of the patient's usual frequency of exertion with the last episode of exertion before the onset of myocardial infarction. RESULTS: From January 1989 through December 1991, 1194 patients (74 percent of whom were men; mean age [+/- SD], 61 +/- 9 years) completed the interview 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. We found that 7.1 percent of the case patients had engaged in physical exertion (> or = 6 metabolic equivalents) at the onset of infarction, as compared with 3.9 percent of the controls at the onset of the control event. For the patients as compared with the matched controls, the adjusted relative risk of having engaged in strenuous physical activity at the onset of infarction or the control event was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6). The case-crossover comparison yielded a similar relative risk of 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.1) for having engaged in strenuous physical activity within one hour before myocardial infarction. Patients whose frequency of regular exercise was less than four and four or more times per week had relative risks of 6.9 and 1.3, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A period of strenuous physical activity is associated with a temporary increase in the risk of having a myocardial infarction, particularly among patients who exercise infrequently. These findings should aid in the identification of the triggering mechanisms for myocardial infarction and improve prevention of this common and serious disorder.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, a number of safety measures for reducing firefighters' exposure to combustion particles have been introduced in Sweden. The most important measure was the reduction in the time firefighters wear suits and handle contaminated equipment after turn-outs involving smoke diving. This study was divided into two parts, those being to investigate the level of protection obtained by multiple garment layers and to assess exposure during a standardized smoke diving exercise. First, realistic work protection factors (WPFs) were calculated by comparing air concentrations of the full suite of gaseous and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) inside and outside structural ensembles, including jacket and thick base layer, during a tough fire extinguishing exercise using wood as the fuel. Second, during a standardized smoke diving exercise, exposure was assessed by measuring PAH skin deposition and levels of eight urinary PAH metabolites in 20 volunteer student firefighters before and after the exercise. The average WPF for the sum of 22 PAHs was 146 ± 33 suggesting a relatively high protective capacity but also indicating a substantial enrichment of contaminants with a risk of prolonged dermal exposure. Accordingly, in the second exercise, the median levels of skin-deposited Σ14-PAHs and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene significantly increased 5-fold (21 to 99 ng/wipe) and 8-fold (0.14 to 1.1 µmol mol-1 creatinine), respectively, post exposure. Among the PAH metabolites investigated, 1-hydroxypyrene proved to be the most useful indicator of exposure, with significantly elevated urinary levels at both 6 h and 20 h after the exercise and with the strongest correlation to dermal exposure. Metabolites from two-ring and three-ring PAHs were eliminated faster while levels of 3-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene did not meet the detection criteria. The results from correlation studies indicated that dermal uptake was a major route of exposure in accordance with previous findings. To summarize, this study shows that some of the newly adopted protective measures were correctly implemented, and should continue to be followed and be more widely adopted.

AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) is primarily used as an industrial degreasing agent and has been in use since the 1940s. TCE is released into the soil, surface, and groundwater. From an environmental and regulatory standpoint, more than half of Superfund hazardous waste sites on the National Priority List are contaminated with TCE. Occupational exposure to TCE occurs primarily via inhalation, while environmental TCE exposure also occurs through ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Current literature links TCE exposure to various adverse health effects including cardiovascular toxicity. Current studies aiming to address developmental cardiovascular toxicity utilized rodent and avian models, with the majority of studies using relatively higher parts per million (mg/L) doses. In this study, to further investigate developmental cardiotoxicity of TCE, zebrafish embryos were treated with 0, 10, 100, or 500 parts per billion (ppb; μg/L) TCE during embryogenesis and/or through early larval stages. After the appropriate exposure period, angiogenesis, F-actin, and mitochondrial function were assessed. A significant dose-response decrease in angiogenesis, F-actin, and mitochondrial function was observed. To further complement this data, a transcriptomic profile of zebrafish larvae was completed to identify gene alterations associated with the 10 ppb TCE exposure. Results from the transcriptomic data revealed that embryonic TCE exposure caused significant changes in genes associated with cardiovascular disease, cancer, and organismal injury and abnormalities with a number of targets in the FAK signaling pathway. Overall, results from our study support TCE as a developmental cardiovascular toxicant, provide molecular targets and pathways for investigation in future studies, and indicate a need for continued priority for environmental regulation.

AB  - When measuring breath-by-breath (BbB) oxygen uptake at the mouth (V MO2 ) as the difference between the amount of inspired and expired oxygen, BbB variation in lung oxygen stores due to BbB variation in end-expiratory lung volume (VLET) introduces an error leading to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio when compared to oxygen uptake at the alveolo-capillary interface (V AO2 ). Conventional BbB measurement of oxygen uptake does not measure BbB changes in lung oxygen stores. Opto-electronic plethysmography(OEP) allows accurate monitoring of absolute lung volume changes and BbB quantification of change in pulmonary oxygen stores. To quantify BbB variation of lung oxygen stores and to assess variability in V MO2 due to BbB variation of lung oxygen stores, we measured, V MO2 and V AO2 in parallel, at rest,during transients and during steady state cycling exercise at 60, 90 and 120W in 7 healthy male subjects. Average V MO2 and V AO2 at steady state were not different (p = 0.328).Direct measurement of V AO2 reduced overall BbB variability by 24% (p < 0.0001) and variance of the difference between V MO2 and V AO2 could be explained for 55% by BbB changes in VLET and expiratory oxygen fraction. V AO2 was higher than V MO215 and 30 s after exercise onset (p < 0.01). We conclude that (1) by taking into account changes in lung oxygen stores BbB variability of oxygen uptake is reduced, (2) alveolar oxygen stores change rapidly during transients to exercise, and (3) changes in alveolar oxygen stores affect BbB oxygen uptake measured at the mouth during the cardio-dynamic phase I.

AB  - BACKGROUND: UK fire services have differing practices relating to the use of a cardiorespiratory fitness standard as a selection criterion for recruits. AIMS: To establish whether a reduction in, or elimination of, a defined cardiorespiratory standard for firefighter recruitment impacted on a number of occupational and health-related outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected on firefighter recruits from services which applied either a minimum recruit cardiorespiratory fitness standard of 42 ml O(2)/kg/min (398 full-time and 48 part-time recruits) or no such direct standard (198 full-time and 206 part-time subjects). VO(2) max estimated, where available, was also recorded and the impact of a reduction in the standard from 45 to 42 ml O(2)/kg/min assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-five per cent of all recruits reported injury during training. Injury-related restrictions were more likely where no cardiorespiratory standard was applied for full-time recruits. For part-time recruits, higher VO(2) max (est.) predicted a lower incidence of injuries. Further adverse health-related outcomes were found for full-time and part-time recruits. Multiple regression analyses suggest that eliminating the 42 ml O(2)/kg/min cardiorespiratory standard at recruitment for full-time firefighters was associated with an 8% (95% CI 7.16-8.84) increase in subsequent injuries reported during training. For part-time firefighters, VO(2) max (est.) was inversely associated with 5% of the variation in injuries (95% CI 4.66-5.34). CONCLUSIONS: Removal of a cardiorespiratory fitness standard was associated with adverse health and employment outcomes. Older age and gender were not associated with adverse outcomes. No reliable evidence of adverse outcomes from a reduction in a cardiorespiratory standard from 45 to 42 ml O(2)/kg/min was found.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. China accounts for over half of the new cases and deaths. Diagnostic imprecision and a lack of complimentary molecular biomarkers are partially responsible for this lack of progress. Herein, serum-derived exosomal microRNA (miRNA) profiling was performed on 80 patients which histologically confirmed HCC and 30 normal controls. A classification of 8 exosomal miRNAs had biologically and statistically significant differences between HCC and normal serum samples, including miR-122, miR-125b, miR-145, miR-192, miR-194, miR-29a, miR-17-5p, and miR-106a. Online algorithm showed strong independent classification accuracy (area under the curve) reached 0.535 to 0.850, separately. The significant correlation between serum exosomal miRNAs and tumor size was observed. In addition, the survival difference of HCC patients with high or low exosomal miR-106a was statistically significant using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Besides, we also measured the proliferation and invasion ability of HCC cells following exosomal miR-106a mimics or inhibitor treatment. After prediction with algorithms, mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways were identified associated with miR-106a's function. In summary, differentially expressed serum exosomal miRNAs can be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic of HCC.

AB  - Abstract The properties of polyurethane containing five kinds of model phenolic additives were investigated. The IR spectra of polyurethane containing phenolic additives indicated that the phenolic additives reacted with isocyanate groups in a polyisocyanate compound. For an index of anticorrosion, the tensile adhesion strength was measured for polyurethane coatings with phenolic additives on steel plates treated with the salt-water spraying test for 3000 h. It was found that there was a relationship between the tensile adhesion strength of polyurethane and the density. We considered the reason to be that the increase in density (i.e., a reduction in free volume) should provide a route to reduce salt-water access to an adhesive bond. The increase in density was explained by the term antiplasticizers, which means that the phenolic additives reduce the free volume that is available for molecular motion in the stiff chain of polyurethane. In the polyurethanes with every phenolic additive, the elongation was increased, the moduli were decreased, the storage modulus was decreased, and the coefficient of thermal expansion was increased. These phenomena are the characteristics of plasticizers. Thus, the phenolic additives have both the character of antiplasticizers and plasticizers, but the polyurethane with phenolic additives had more characteristics of plasticizers than those of antiplasticizers. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The purposes of this study were (1) to determine normal values for cervical active range of motion (AROM) obtained with a "cervical-range-of-motion" (CROM) instrument on healthy subjects whose ages spanned 9 decades, (2) to determine whether age and gender affect six cervical AROMs, and (3) to examine the intratester and intertester reliability of measurements obtained. Measurements were made on 337 subjects (171 females and 166 males) whose ages ranged from 11 to 97 years. Measurements were taken by five physical therapists with 7 to 30 years of clinical and teaching experience. Among male and female subjects of the same age, females had a greater AROM than did males for all AROMs except neck flexion. Among both males and females, each of the six cervical AROMs decreased significantly with age. From two pilot studies separate from the acquisition of the normal database, we determined our intratester and intertester reliabilities for making neck AROM measurements with the CROM instrument. We concluded that AROM measurements on the cervical spine with the CROM instrument demonstrated good intratester and intertester reliability, because the intraclass correlation coefficients were generally greater than .80.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease risk factors are prevalent among firefighters in some developed countries. It is unclear whether physical activity and cardiopulmonary fitness reduce cardiovascular disease risk and the cardiovascular workload at work in firefighters. The present study investigated the relationship between leisure-time physical activity, cardiopulmonary fitness, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and cardiovascular workload at work in firefighters in Hong Kong. METHODS: Male firefighters (n = 387) were randomly selected from serving firefighters in Hong Kong (n = 5,370) for the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, known cardiovascular diseases). One-third (Target Group) were randomly selected for the assessment of off-duty leisure-time physical activity using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed, as well as cardiovascular workload using heart rate monitoring for each firefighter for four "normal" 24-hour working shifts and during real-situation simulated scenarios. RESULTS: Overall, 33.9% of the firefighters had at least two cardiovascular disease risk factors. In the Target Group, firefighters who had higher leisure-time physical activity had a lower resting heart rate and a lower average working heart rate, and spent a smaller proportion of time working at a moderate-intensity cardiovascular workload. Firefighters who had moderate aerobic fitness and high leisure-time physical activity had a lower peak working heart rate during the mountain rescue scenario compared with firefighters who had low leisure-time physical activities. CONCLUSION: Leisure-time physical activity conferred significant benefits during job tasks of moderate cardiovascular workload in firefighters in Hong Kong.

AB  - The upper trapezius (UT) has been widely studied and related to alterations in clavicular kinematics in subject with shoulder disorders. However, the most common electrode site used to capture UT EMG is between C7 and the acromion, placing the electrodes over the acromial fibers rather than clavicular ones. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between clavicular movements (elevation and retraction) and UT EMG recorded from three electrode sites (traditional electrode positioning and two different sites proposed for clavicular fibers evaluation). Furthermore, the position associated with the highest EMG during maximal isometric voluntary contractions (MVIC), for each electrode site, was determined for normalization purposes. EMG was simultaneously captured in the three electrode sites of 20 healthy subjects, during MVIC at five different positions and during shoulder elevation and abduction in scapular plane. Clavicular kinematics was recorded using an electromagnetic tracking system during the dynamic contractions. Shoulder abduction with head rotation and lateral flexion elicited the highest EMG amplitude on the three electrode sites and was used to normalize the signals. A cross-correlation analysis showed high correlations between all electrode sites and clavicular movements. However, the traditional electrode site seems to record more informative signals in healthy subjects.

AB  - Exosomes are nano-sized biovesicles of endocytic origin physiologically released by nearly all cell types into surrounding body fluids. They carry cell-specific cargos of protein, lipids, and genetic materials and can be selectively taken up by neighboring or distant cells. Since the intrinsic properties of exosomes are strictly influenced by the state of the parental cell and by the cellular microenvironment, the analysis of exosome origin and content, and their cell-targeting specificity, make them attractive as possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. While the possible role of exosomes as messengers and a regenerative tool in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is actively investigated, the evidence about their usefulness as biomarkers is still limited and incomplete. Further complications are due to the lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate approach for exosome isolation and characterization, both important issues for their effective clinical translation. As a consequence, in this review, we will discuss the few information currently accessible about the diagnostic/prognostic potential of exosomes in CVDs and on the methodologies available for exosome isolation, analysis, and characterization.

AB  - AbstractThe study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 3-week n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) supplementation on serum nitric oxide (NO), asymmetric dimethyloarginine (ADMA), ultrasound indices of endothelial function and maximal oxygen uptake of elite cyclists. The effects of dietary supplementation (n-3 PUFA at a dose of 1.3 g twice daily for 3 weeks) and placebo administration on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), pulse wave velocity, serum markers (NO, ADMA), lipid profile, and were analysed in 13 cyclists both before and after dietary protocols. Significant differences between pre- and post-intervention baseline NO levels were observed after n-3 PUFA dietary protocol (13.9 ± 4.2 vs. 23.5 ± 3.6 µmol·l?1; P < 0.001). Higher post-intervention baseline NO level was observed after n-3 PUFA diet compared with placebo (23.5 ± 3.6 vs. 15.3 ± 3.0 µmol·l ?1; P < 0.01, respectively). The n-3 PUFA increased baseline NO concentration (?NO) by 6.7 ± 3.8 µmol·l?1 and placebo by 1.6 ± 4.4 µmol·l?1. The positive correlation was observed between baseline post-intervention NO concentration and maximal oxygen uptake (r = 0.72; P < 0.01) and also between ?NO and (r = 0.54; P < 0.05) in response to omega-3 fatty acids supplementation. There was an association between a 5.25% higher FMD (P < 0.05) and higher (P < 0.001) after n-3 PUFA diet compared with lower values of placebo (r = 0.68; P < 0.05). These findings suggest that an increase in NO release in response to n-3 PUFA supplementation may play a central role in cardiovascular adaptive mechanisms and enhanced exercise performance in cyclists.

AB  - Most test methods use skin burn prediction to evaluate the thermal protective performance of clothing. In this paper, we reviewed different burn prediction methods used in clothing evaluation. The empirical criterion and the mathematical model were analyzed in detail as well as their relationship and limitations. Using an empirical criterion, the onset of skin burn is determined by the accumulated skin surface energy in certain periods. On the other hand, the mathematical model, which indicates denatured collagen, is more complex, which involves a heat transfer model and a burn model. Further studies should be conducted to examine the situations where the prediction methods are derived. New technologies may be used in the future to explore precise or suitable prediction methods for both flash fire tests and increasingly lower-intensity tests.

AB  - Unilateral load carriage is more hazardous to the musculoskeletal system than bilateral load. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of such asymmetric carriage on postures and gait symmetry in ground reaction force (GRF) during walking. Kinematics and GRF of 19 adults were recorded while they walked under five load conditions: no load, dumbbell (10 and 20% body weight) held in right and left hand, respectively. After loading, the trunk bent towards the loaded or unloaded side in right- and left-hand trials and under different load weight conditions. The amplitude of trunk bend increased with load, accompanied by decreased stride width, progressively inclined legs towards unloaded side and higher level of asymmetry in medial/lateral GRF (GRFm/l) and free vertical moment GRF (GRFm). The findings indicate the postural adjustment is likely related to the characteristics of load and the task experience and handedness of subject and the unilateral load increases the gait asymmetry in GRFm/l and GRFm.

AB  - Laminin-111 (α1, β1, γ1; LM-111) is an important component of the extracellular matrix that is required for formation of skeletal muscle during embryonic development. Recent studies suggest that LM-111 supplementation can enhance satellite cell proliferation and muscle function in mouse models of muscular dystrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which LM-111 can alter satellite and nonsatellite stem cell quantity following eccentric exercise-induced damage in young adult, healthy mice. One week following injection of LM-111 or saline, mice either remained sedentary or were subjected to a single bout of downhill running (EX). While one muscle was preserved for evaluation of satellite cell number, the other muscle was processed for isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; Sca-1+CD45-) via FACS at 24 hours postexercise. Satellite cell number was approximately twofold higher in LM-111/EX compared with all other groups (p<.05), and the number of satellite cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 was 50% to threefold higher in LM-111/EX compared with all other groups (p<.05). LM-111 also increased the quantity of embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive (eMHC+) fibers in young mice after eccentric exercise (p<.05). Although MSC percentage and number were not altered, MSC proinflammatory gene expression was decreased, and hepatocyte growth factor gene expression was increased in the presence of LM-111 (p<.05). Together, these data suggest that LM-111 supplementation provides a viable solution for increasing skeletal muscle stem cell number and/or function, ultimately allowing for improvements in the regenerative response to eccentric exercise.
